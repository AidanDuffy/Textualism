In this case, 
we 
are
asked 
to 
decide
whether
the 
two 
statutes 
under
which 
defendant 
stands 
convicted — namely, 
section 
24-1.6(a)(1),
(a)(3)(A) of 
the AUUW 
statute 
and section 
24-3.1(a)(1)
of the UPF
statute — violate 
the 
right 
to 
keep 
and 
bear
arms, 
as 
guaranteed 
by
the
second amendment 
to the
United 
States 
Constit
ution. Before 
we get
to those questions, however, we must 
quickly
dispose 
of the State’s
argument 
that 
defendant 
lacks 
standing
to 
contest 
the 
constitutionality
of 
these 
statutes. 
In 
support 
of 
this 
argument, 
the 
State 
invokes 
the
familiar 
principle 
that, 
in 
order
to 
have
standing
to 
contest 
the
constitutionality
of 
a 
statutory
provision, 
the 
party
bringing 
that
challenge 
must 
show 
that 
he 
falls 
within 
the 
class
of 
persons
aggrieved 
by
the 
alleged 
unconstitutionality. 
See, 
e.g., 
People 
v.
Bombacino, 
51 
I
ll. 
2d 
17, 
20 
(1972). 
According
to 
the 
State,
this
principle 
means 
that, 
in 
this 
case, 
before 
defendant 
can 
argue 
that
either 
of 
these 
statutes 
violates 
the 
second 
amendment, 
he 
first 
must
be 
able 
to 
show 
that 
he 
was
engaged 
in 
conduct 
that 
enjoys 
second
amendment 
protection. 
Yet 
there
is 
no 
way
defendant 
can 
do 
this, 
the
State 
maintains, 
because 
defendant 
himself 
concedes 
that 
the 
conduct
involved
in 
this 
case
, 
namely
, 
possessing 
a 
loaded, 
defaced, 
and
illegally
modified 
handgun 
on 
another
person’s 
property
without
consent, 
enjoys 
no 
such 
protection. 
Thus, 
the 
State 
insists
, 
defendant
has no standing
 to bring
 a second amendment challenge.
We 
reject 
the 
State’s 
argument. 
The 
State 
assumes 
that 
defendant
is 
arguing 
that 
the 
enforcement 
of 
sections 
24-1.6(a)(1)
, 
(a)
(3)(A) 
and
24-3.1(a)(1)
in 
this 
particular 
case
violates 
his 
personal 
right 
to 
keep
and 
bear
arms, 
as 
guaranteed 
by
the 
second 
amendment. 
But 
that 
is
not 
what 
defendant 
is 
arguing. 
Rather, 
he 
is 
arguing 
that 
sections 
24-1.6(a)
(1), 
(a)(3)(A) 
and 
24-3.1(a)(1)
themselves
facially
violate 
the
second 
amendment, 
and 
that 
consequently
neither 
statute 
can 
be
enforced 
against
anyone
, 
defendant 
included. 
See, 
e.g., 
People 
v.
Manuel
, 
94 
I
ll. 
2d 
242, 
244
-4
5
(1983) 
(a 
defendant 
cannot
be
prosecuted 
under 
a 
criminal 
statute 
that
is
unconstitutional 
in 
its
entirety
, 
as 
such 
a 
statute 
is 
void 
ab 
initio
). 
This 
is 
a 
very
different
argument 
from 
the 
one 
the 
State 
assumes, 
and 
one 
that 
defendant
undoubtedly
has 
the 
standing
to 
make. 
“One
has 
standing
to 
challenge
the 
validity
of 
a 
statute 
if 
he 
has 
sustained 
or 
if 
he 
is 
in 
immediate
danger 
of 
sustaining 
some 
direct 
injury
as 
a 
result 
of 
enforcement 
of
the 
statute.” 
People 
v. 
Mayberry
, 
63 
I
ll. 
2d 
1, 
8 
(1976). 
Here, 
sections
24-1.6(a)(1)
, 
(a)(3)(A)
and 
24-3.1(a)(1)
were 
enforced 
against
defendant 
in 
the 
form 
of 
a 
criminal 
prosecution 
initiated 
by
the
People 
of 
the 
State 
of 
llinois
, 
and 
the 
“direct 
injury
” 
he 
sustained 
was
the 
entry
of 
two 
felony
convictions 
for 
which 
he 
was 
sentenced 
to 
24
months’ 
probation. 
If 
anyone 
has 
standing
to 
challenge 
the 
validity
of
these 
sections, it is defendant. Or to put it another way
, if defendant
does 
not
have 
standing
to 
challenge 
the 
validity
of 
these 
sections, 
then
no one does. The
 State’s standing
 objection is rejected.
We 
now 
turn
to
the 
main 
issue, 
namely
, 
the 
constitutionality
 of
the 
two 
statutes 
at 
issue. 
We 
begin 
with
section 
24-1.6(a)(1)
,
(a)(3)(A), which states:
“(a) A person commits 
the 
offense 
of 
aggravated 
unlawful
use of a

 or she knowingly

Carries

of 
business 
any
pistol, 
revolver, 
stun 
gun 
or

or
other firearm;
(3) One
 of the following

(A) 
the

Statutes 
are
presumed 
constitutional,

the 
party
challenging 
the
constitutionality
of 
a

carries 
the

of 
proving
that 
the
statute is unconstitutional.

Moreover, 
this 
court 
has 
a 
duty
to 
construe 
the 
statute 
in 
a 
manner
that
upholds 
the 
statute’s 
validity
and 
constitutionality

it

In
District 
of
Columbia 
v. 
Heller
, 
554 
U.S. 
570 
(2008), 
the 
Supreme
Court 
undertook its 
first
ever “in-depth 
examination” 
of the second
amendment’s 
meaning
. 
Id
. 
at 
635. 
After
a 
lengthy
historical
discussion, 
the 
Court 
ultimately
concluded 
that 
the 
second
amendment 
“guarantee[s]
the 
individual 
right 
to 
possess 
and 
carry
weapons 
in 
case
of confrontation” (
id
. 
at 592); 
that 
“central to” this
right 
is 
“the
inherent 
right 
of 
self-defense
” 
(id
. 
at 
628); 
that 
“the
home” 
is 
“where 
the 
need 
for 
defense 
of 
self, 
family
, 
and 
property
is
most 
acute
” 
(
id
. 
at 
628); 
and 
that, 
“above
all
other 
interests,” 
the
second 
amendment 
elevates 
“the 
right 
of 
law 
abiding, 
responsible
citizens 
to 
use 
arms 
in 
defense 
of 
hearth 
and 
home” 
(
id
. 
at 
635).
Based 
on 
this 
understanding
, 
the 
Court 
held 
that 
a 
District
of
Columbia 
law 
banning
handgun 
possession 
in 
the 
home 
violated 
the
second amendment.

Two years later, in

, 
561 
U.S. ___,
___, 130 S. 
Ct. 
3020, 
3050 
(2010), the 
Supreme Court 
held that the

recognized 
in 
Heller
is 
applicable
to 
the
states 
through
the 
due 
process 
clause
of 
the 
fourteenth 
amendment.
In 
so 
holding, 
the 
Court 
reiterated 
that
“the 
Second 
Amendment
protects
the 
right 
to 
keep 
and 
bear
arms 
for 
the 
purpose 
of 
self-defense” 
(

that 
“individual 
self-defense

central 
component
’ 
of 
the 
Second 
Amendment 
right”
(emphasis
in 
original)

right, 
recognized
by
 many
 legal systems from ancient times to the present 
day
” 
(

The 
issue 
before
us
today
is
whether
section
2
4-1.6(a)(1)
,
(a)(3)(A) 
violates 
the 
second 
amendment 
right 
to 
keep

bear

as 
construed 
by
the 
United

Supreme 
Court 
in 
Heller
and
McDonald

We 
are
not 
the 
first 
court 
to 
consider 
this 
question. 
On 
the
contrary
, 
the 
constitutionality
of 
section 
24-1.6(a)(1)
, 
(a)(3)(A) 
has
been 
considered 
by
several 
panels 
of 
our 
appellate
court. 
See, 
e.g

(a)(3)(A) 
passes 
constitutional 
muster.
According
to 
these 
decisions, 
despite 
their 
broad 
and 
lengthy
historical 
discussions 
concerning
the 
scope 
and 
meaning
of

neither 
Heller

McDonald
expressly
recognizes 
a 
right 
to 
keep

outside

. 
Rather, 
the
core
holding of 
both 
cases 
is 
that 
“the Second

the 
right 
to 
possess 
a

In 
stark 
contrast 
to 
these 
Illinois
decisions
stands
the 
Seventh
Circuit 
Court 
of 
Appeals’ 
recent 
decision 
in 
Moore 
v. 
Madigan
, 
702
F.3d 
933 
(7th 
Cir. 
2012). 
In 
Moore
, 
the 
court 
held 
that 
section 
24-1.6(a)(1), 
(a)(3)(A) 
is 
effectively
“a 
flat 
ban 
on 
carrying 
ready-to-use
guns 
outside 
the home” (
id.
at 940) 
and that, 
as such, 
it 
violates
the
second 
amendment 
right 
to 
keep 
and 
bear
arms, 
as 
construed 
in
Heller
and 
McDonald
(
id
. 
at 
942). 
In 
reaching
this 
result, 
Moore
relied
not 
on 
the 
specific
holding 
of 
Heller—i.e.
, 
that 
the 
second
amendment 
protects
the 
right 
to 
possess 
a 
handgun 
in 
the 
home 
for
the 
purpose 
of 
self-defense
—but 
rather 
on 
the 
broad 
principles 
that
informed 
that 
holding. 
According
to 
Moore
, 
the 
clear 
implication of
Heller’s 
extensive historical analysis 
is 
that 
“the 
constitutional right
of 
armed 
self-defense
is 
broader 
than 
the 
right 
to 
have 
a gun 
in 
one’s
home.” 
Id
. 
at 
935. 
Moore
notes, 
for 
example, 
that 
“the 
first 
sentence
of 
the 
McDonald
opinion
states 
that 
‘two 
years
ago, 
in
District 
of
Columbia 
v. 
Heller
, 
we 
held 
that 
the 
Second 
Amendment 
protects 
the
right 
to 
keep and bear arms 
for the 
purpose of 
self-defense
.’ ” 
Id
. 
at
935 
(quoting
McDonald
, 
561 
U.S
.
at
_
_
_, 
130 
S. 
Ct. 
at 
3026).
Moreover, 
Moore
explains 
that, 
although 
both 
Heller
and 
McDonald
state that the need for self-defense is “most acute” in the home, that
“doesn’t 
mean 
it 
is 
not 
acute
outside 
the 
home.” 
Id
. 
(quoting
McDonald
, 
561 
U.S. 
at 
___, 
130 
S. 
Ct. 
at 
3036, 
and 
Heller
, 
554 
U.S.
at 628). On the
 contrary
:
“
Heller
repeatedly
invokes 
a 
broader 
Second 
Amendment
right 
than 
the 
right 
to 
have 
a 
gun 
in 
one’s
home, 
as 
when 
it
says 
that 
the 
amendment 
‘guarantees
the 
individual 
right 
to
possess 
and 
carry
weapons 
in 
case
of 
confrontation.’
[Citation.]
Confrontations 
are
not 
limited 
to 
the 
home.” 
Id.
at
935-36 (quoting
Heller
, 554 U.S. at 592).
Finally
, 
Moore
notes 
that 
the 
second 
amendment 
guarantees 
not 
only
the 
right 
to 
“keep” 
arms, 
but 
also 
the 
right 
to 
“bear” 
arms,
and 
that
these rights are not the same:
“The
right 
to 
‘bear’ as 
distinct 
from the 
right 
to
‘keep’ arms
is 
unlikely
to
refer 
to 
the 
home. 
To 
speak 
of 
‘bearing’ 
arms
within 
one’s 
home 
would 
at 
all 
times 
have 
been 
an 
awkward
usage. 
A 
right 
to 
bear
arms 
thus
implies 
a 
right 
to 
carry
a
loaded gun outside the home.” 
Id
. at 936.
I
n 
other 
words,
Moore
concludes, 
“the 
Supreme 
Court 
has 
decided
that 
the 
second 
amendment 
confers 
a 
right 
to 
bear
arms 
for
self-defense
, 
which 
is 
as 
important 
outside 
the 
home 
as 
inside.” 
Id
. 
at
942. 
As 
a 
result, 
Moore
held 
that 
Illinois’ 
“flat 
ban 
on 
carrying 
ready
-to-use guns outside the
home,” 
as 
embodied 
in section 24-1.6(a)(1)
,
(a)(3)(A), is unconstitutional on its face. 
Id
 at 940
 After
reviewing
these 
two 
lines 
of 
authority
—the 
Illinois
 cases
holding 
that 
section 
24-1.6(a)(1)
, 
(a)
(3)(A) 
is 
constitutional, 
and 
the
Seventh Circuit’s decision 
holding 
that it 
is 
not—we are convinced
that 
the 
Seventh 
Circuit’s 
analysis 
is 
the 
correct 
one. 
As 
the 
Seventh
Circuit 
correctly
noted, 
neither 
Heller 
nor 
McDonald
expressly
limits
the 
second 
amendment’s 
protections 
to 
the 
home. 
On 
the 
contrary
both 
decisions 
contain 
language 
strongly
suggesting 
if 
not 
outright
confirming 
that
the 
second 
amendment 
right 
to 
keep 
and 
bear
arms
extends 
beyond 
the 
home. 
Moreover, 
if 
Heller
means 
what 
it 
says
,
and 
“individual 
self-defense
” 
is 
indeed 
“the 
central 
component” 
of
the 
second 
amendment 
right 
to 
keep 
and 
bear
arms 
(Heller, 
554 
U.S.
at 
599), 
then 
it 
would 
make 
little 
sense 
to 
restrict 
that
right 
to 
the
home, 
as 
“confrontations 
are
not 
limited 
to 
the 
home.” 
Moore
, 
702
F.3d 
at 
935-36
.
Indeed, 
Heller
itself 
recognizes 
as 
much 
when 
it
states 
that 
“the 
right 
to 
have 
arms 
*** 
was 
by
the 
time 
of 
the 
founding
understood 
to 
be 
an 
individual 
right 
protecting 
against 
both 
public
and 
private 
violence.”
(Emphasis 
added.)
Heller
, 
554 
U.S. 
at 
593-94.
Of 
course
, 
in 
concluding
that 
the 
second 
amendment 
protects the
right to 
possess and 
use 
a 
firearm 
for 
self-defense
outside 
the 
home,
we 
are
in 
no 
way
saying 
that 
such 
a 
right 
is 
unlimited 
or 
is 
not 
subject
to 
meaningful 
regulation. 
See 
infra¶¶ 
26-27. 
That 
said, 
we 
cannot
escape 
the 
reality
that
,
in
this 
case
, 
we 
are
dealing
not 
with 
a
reasonable 
regulation 
but 
with 
a 
comprehensive 
ban. 
Again, 
in 
the
form 
presently
before 
us, 
section 
24-1.6(a)(1)
, 
(a)(3)(A) 
categorically
prohibits 
the 
possession 
and 
use 
of 
an 
operable 
firearm 
for 
self-defense 
outside 
the 
home. 
In 
other 
words, 
section 
24-1.6(a)(1),
(a)(3)(A) 
amounts 
to 
a 
wholesale
statutory
ban 
on 
the 
exercise 
of 
a
personal 
right
that 
is 
specifically
named 
in 
and 
guaranteed 
by
the
United 
States 
Constitution, 
as 
construed 
by
the 
United 
States
Supreme 
Court. 
In 
no 
other 
context 
would 
we 
permit 
this, 
and 
we 
will
not permit it here either.
Accordingly
, 
as the Seventh
Circuit 
did 
in 
Moore
, 
we here hold
that, 
on 
its 
face, 
section 
24-1.6(a)(1)
, 
(a)(3)(A) 
violates 
the 
right 
to
keep 
and 
bear
arms, 
as 
guaranteed 
by
the 
second 
amendment 
to 
the
United 
States 
Constitution.
Defendant’s 
conviction 
under 
that 
section
there
fore
 is reversed.
According
to 
defendant, 
at 
the 
time 
the 
second 
amendment 
was
drafted 
and 
ratified, 
the 
right 
to 
keep 
and 
bear
arms
extended 
to
persons 
16 
and 
17 
years 
of 
age. 
In 
support, 
defendant 
relies
principally
on 
the 
fact 
that, 
at 
the 
time 
of 
this 
nation’s 
founding
, 
many
colonies 
“required
those 
as 
young
as 
15 
years 
old 
to 
bear
arms” 
for
purposes
of
militia service
. 
Consequently
, 
defendant 
argues, 
“because
Illinois’ 
ban 
on 
handgun 
possession 
by
17-year
-olds
regulates
conduct
that 
traditionally
falls 
within 
the 
protection 
of 
the 
second 
amendment,
the 
validity
of 
the 
law 
depends 
upon 
the 
government’s 
ability
to
satisfy
heightened 
constitutional 
scrutiny
.” 
Defendant then
insists
that
the 
State 
cannot 
meet 
this 
burden 
because 
“Illinois
’ 
unconditional
abrogation 
of 
a 
17-year
-old’s
constitutional 
right 
to 
defend 
himself
with 
a 
handgun” 
is 
in 
no 
way
tailored 
to 
meet 
any
identifiable 
state
interest. 
In 
other 
words, 
defendant 
is 
arguing 
that, 
as 
far
as 
the 
second
amendment 
is 
concerned, 
a 
17-year
-old 
minor 
is 
on 
exactly
the 
same
constitutional footing as a
 full-fledged adult.
We 
reject 
this 
argument. 
In 
Heller
, 
the 
Supreme 
Court expressly
stated that:
“Like 
most 
rights, 
the 
right 
secured 
by
the 
Second
Amendment 
is
not 
unlimited. 
From 
Blackstone 
through 
the
19th-century
cases, 
commentators 
and 
courts 
routinely
explained 
that 
the 
right was 
not a right to 
keep 
and 
carry
any
weapon 
whatsoever 
in 
any
manner 
whatsoever 
and 
for
whatever purpose
.” 
Heller
, 554 U.S. at 626.
From 
there
, 
the 
Court 
went 
on 
to 
emphasize 
that 
“nothing
in 
our
opinion 
should 
be 
taken 
to 
cast 
doubt 
on 
longstanding 
prohibitions 
on
the 
possession 
of 
firearms 
by
felons 
and 
the 
mentally ill
,
or laws
forbidding
the 
carrying 
of 
firearms 
in 
sensitive 
places 
such 
as 
schools
and 
government 
buildings, 
or 
laws 
imposing 
conditions 
and
qualifications
on
the 
commercial 
sale 
of 
arms.” 
Id
. 
at 
626-27. 
The
Court 
then 
immediately
added, 
by
way
of 
footnote, 
that 
“we 
identify
these
presumptively
lawful 
regulatory
measures 
only
as 
examples; 
our
list does not purport to be exhaustive.” 
Id.
 at 627 n.26. 
 Now 
admittedly
,
the 
list
enumerated 
in
Heller
does
not
specifically
include 
laws 
prohibiting 
the 
possession 
of 
firearms 
by
minors.
Nevertheless, 
several 
courts 
have 
since 
undertaken 
a
thorough
historical 
examination 
of 
such 
laws, 
and 
all 
of 
them 
have
concluded 
that, 
contrary
to 
defendant’s 
contention, 
the 
possession 
of
handguns 
by
minors 
is 
conduct 
that 
falls 
outside 
the 
scope 
of
the
second 
amendment’s 
protection. 
See, 
e.g.
,
National 
Rifle 
Ass’n 
of
America, 
Inc. 
v. 
Bureau 
of A
lcohol, 
Tobacco, 
Firearms, 
Explosives
,
700 
F.3d 
185, 
204 
(5th 
Cir. 
2012) 
(concluding 
that 
“modern
restrictions 
on 
the 
ability
of 
persons 
under 
21 
to 
purchase
handguns
—
and 
the 
ability
of 
persons 
under 
18 
to 
possess
handguns—seem, 
to 
us, 
to 
be 
firmly
historically
rooted”
);
United
States 
v. 
Rene
E.
, 
583 
F.3d 
8, 
16 
(1st 
Cir. 
2009) 
(concluding 
that 
the
“right 
to 
keep 
arms 
in 
the 
founding
period 
did
not
extend 
to
juveniles
”)
; 
Powell 
v. 
Tompkins
, 
No. 
12-10744-WGY, 
2013 
WL
765339, 
at 
*16 
(D. 
Mass 
Fe
b. 
28, 
2013) 
(holding
that 
a 
Massachusetts
law proscribing
 the 
carry
of 
firearms 
by
persons 
under 
the age of 21
“comports 
with 
the 
Second 
Amendment 
and 
imposes 
no 
burden 
on”
the 
right 
to 
keep 
and 
bear
arms). 
In 
essence, 
these 
cases 
explain 
that,
although 
many
colonies 
permitted 
or 
even 
required
minors 
to 
own
and 
possess 
firearms 
for 
purposes 
of 
militia 
service
, 
nothing 
like 
a
right 
for 
minors 
to 
own 
and 
possess 
firearms 
has 
existed 
at 
any
time
in
this
nation’s 
history
. 
On 
the 
contrary
, 
laws 
banning
the 
juvenile
possession 
of 
firearms 
have 
been 
commonplace
for 
almost 
150 
years
and 
both 
reflect 
and 
comport 
with 
a 
“long
standing
practice 
of prohibiting 
certain 
classes 
of 
individuals 
from 
possessing
firearms—those 
whose 
possession 
poses 
a 
particular 
danger 
to 
the
public.
” 
Rene, 
583 
F.3d 
at 
15. 
We 
will 
not 
repeat 
or 
rehash 
the
historical 
evidence 
set 
forth 
in 
these 
decisions. 
Rather,
for 
present
purposes, 
we 
need 
only
express 
our 
agreement 
with the
obvious 
and
undeniable 
conclusion that the possession of handguns by
minors is
conduct 
that 
falls 
outside 
the scope 
of 
the 
second 
amendment’s
protection.
For 
these 
reasons, 
we 
reject 
defendant’s
second
amendment
challenge 
to 
section 
24-3.1(a)(1) and
affirm 
his 
conviction
there
under.
For
the 
reasons 
set forth 
above, 
we 
reverse 
defendant’s conviction
under section 
24-1.6(a)(1)
, 
(a)(3)(A), affirm defendant’s 
conviction
under 
section 
24-3.1(a)(1)
, 
and 
remand
to
the 
trial 
court 
for
imposition 
of 
sentence 
on 
the 
UPF 
conviction. 
The 
sentence 
imposed
on 
the 
UPF 
conviction 
shall 
not 
exceed 
the 
sentence 
imposed 
on 
the
AUUW 
conviction, 
and 
defendant 
shall 
receive 
credit 
for 
time
already
 served on the AUUW conviction.
