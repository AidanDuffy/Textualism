ARTICLES
THE RIGHT NOT TO KEEP OR BEAR ARMS
Joseph Blocher*
Sometimes a constitutional right to do a particular thing is accompanied by
a right not to do that thing. The First Amendment, for example, guarantees both
the right to speak and the right not to speak. This Article asks whether the Second
Amendment should likewise be read to encompass both the right to keep or bear
arms for self-defense and the inverse right to protect oneself by avoiding arms,
and what practical implications, if any, the latter right would have. The Article
concludes—albeit with some important qualifications—that a right not to keep or
bear arms is implied by what the Supreme Court has called the “core” and “central
component” of the Second Amendment: self-defense, especially in the home.
Recognizing such a right might call into question the constitutionality of the
growing number of “anti-gun control” laws that make it difficult or illegal for
private individuals to avoid having guns in their actual or constructive possession.

INTRODUCTION
In District of Columbia v. Heller,
1
 the Supreme Court held that the Second
Amendment guarantees an individual right to keep and bear arms for purposes
of self-defense.2
 In doing so, the Court rejected the idea that the amendment’s
function is to protect the state militias from disarmament by the federal government,
finding instead that the original public understanding of the Second
Amendment gives individuals the right to keep and bear arms disconnected
from military service, and that it “elevates above all other interests the right of
law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.”3
The Court went on to conclude that “keeping” a gun means having it in one’s
constructive possession—in the home, for example—and that “bearing” a gun
means carrying it on one’s person.4
 These actions are constitutionally protected
because they advance the “central component” or “core lawful purpose” of the
Second Amendment: freedom of self-defense,5
 particularly in the home.6

But what if a person believes that the best way to defend himself against
violence in his home is to keep guns out of it? After all, despite the undoubted
importance of the right to self-defense and the political popularity of the Supreme
Court’s “individual rights” reading of the Second Amendment,7
 a majority
of Americans choose not to keep guns in their homes.8
 Many if not most
make that decision for personal safety reasons,9
 and even among gun owners,
only a minority say that their primary motivation for having a gun is selfprotection
against crime.10 Empirical data regarding self-defense and gun ownership
are notoriously contested,11 and often unpersuasive,12 so it may be imarms

possible to say whether avoiding guns is, statistically speaking, the “right” safety
decision. But since Heller entrusts that decision to the individual, the statistics
should be largely irrelevant as a constitutional matter.13 A person who believes
her home to be safer without a gun is attempting to protect herself from a
risk of future violence, just like a person who chooses to keep a handgun on her
bedside table. If self-defense is the “core” of the Second Amendment, why
should only one of these decisions be constitutionally protected? Shouldn’t the
interests giving rise to the affirmative right also protect a person’s freedom not
to exercise it?
The central idea explored in this Article is that the Second Amendment’s
guarantee of an individual right to keep or bear arms in self-defense should include
the freedom not to keep or bear them at all. Though such a “negative”
Second Amendment self-defense right has never been recognized, nor even
thoroughly discussed,14 rights not to engage in constitutionally protected activities
are well established in other areas of law.15 This is especially but not uniquely
true in First Amendment doctrine, which in turn has often been used as a
guidepost for the Second Amendment.16 Indeed, the freedom not to speak has
famously been called a “fixed star in our constitutional constellation,”17 precisely
because it serves the same First Amendment values as speech itself: individual
autonomy, the marketplace of ideas, and so on. As Chief Justice Burger
wrote in Wooley v. Maynard, “[t]he right to speak and the right to refrain
 13. See District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 634 (2008) (“The very enumeration
of the right takes out of the hands of government—even the Third Branch of Government—the
power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether the right is really worth insisting
upon.”).
 14. The closest analogues are the “conscientious objector” provisions found in the
gun-rights guarantees of many state constitutions and in an early draft of the Second
Amendment itself. These are addressed in more detail below, see infra Part III.B, but are not
analogous to the “negative” right described here, because they apply to military service, not
bearing arms in self-defense.
 15. See JOHN H. GARVEY, WHAT ARE FREEDOMS FOR? 17 (1996) (“[T]he idea that
freedoms are bilateral” means “that the freedom to do x entails the freedom not to do x.”); id.
at 39 (“It is axiomatic in modern constitutional law that freedoms are bilateral rights.”).
As noted in the Conclusion of this Article, having a right not to engage in particular
constitutionally salient activities such as speech, religious practice, or association is not the
same thing as having a generalized right against coercion. Some constitutional challenges to
the individual mandate provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 26
U.S.C. § 5000A (Supp. IV 2010), have relied on something like the latter. This Article has
nothing to offer them. I attempt a broader account and explanation in Joseph Blocher, Rights

from speaking are complementary components of the broader concept of ‘individual
freedom of mind.’”18 Justice Brennan emphasized that symmetry in Riley
v. National Federation of the Blind of North Carolina: “[T]he First
Amendment guarantees ‘freedom of speech,’ a term necessarily comprising the
decision of both what to say and what not to say.”19 Following the same logic,
one might say that after Heller the Second Amendment guarantees freedom of
armed self-protection, a concept necessarily comprising the decision of both
what arms to keep and what arms not to keep.
But what would it mean to have a right not to keep or bear arms, and what
relevance would that right have in practice? Traditionally, gun regulations have
limited citizens’ ability to have or carry guns. The usual Second Amendment
question, therefore, has been whether such limitations are constitutional. But
some legislatures are now contemplating or doing something quite different:
pursuing “anti-gun control” laws that supersede private ordering by making it
difficult or illegal for private parties to keep guns out of their homes, off their
property, and otherwise out of their actual or constructive possession. Perhaps
most radically, some have proposed or enacted laws requiring citizens to keep
guns in their homes.20 Many others have adopted “forced entry” or “take your
gun to work” laws, which require private parties—usually businesses—to allow
guns on their property.21 And even concealed carry rules arguably burden the
ability not to keep arms, because they make it substantially more difficult for
people to monitor whether unwanted guns are being brought onto their property
or into their homes.22
Parts I and II of this Article argue that the new self-defense-based reading
of the Second Amendment suggests recognition of a right not to keep or bear
arms; Part III explores that right’s practical significance. Part I begins by describing
how the terms “keep” and “bear” were redefined through changing interpretations
of the Second Amendment’s core purpose. Though those words
were long understood to have a military connotation, scholars, advocates, and
courts in recent decades have come to see them as referring to private, individual
possession and use of guns. This new understanding, which broadly equates
“keeping” a gun with “having” it in one’s possession and “bearing” a gun with
“carrying” it, is intertwined with the new view of the Second Amendment as
grounded in self-protection.
Part II explores the constitutional protection of rights not to engage in activities
which would, if undertaken voluntarily, be constitutionally protected.
Not every constitutional right carries with it such an inverse right. There is no

Thirteenth Amendment right to sell oneself into slavery, for example.23 But
others do—people have constitutional rights to decide whether to speak,24
whether to associate,25 “whether to bear or beget a child,”26 and whether to accept
the assistance of counsel.27 Such rights often exist where the underlying
reasons for protecting the “affirmative” right are also furthered by the “negative”
right. Thus the First Amendment protects speech and silence because they
both serve core First Amendment purposes like the protection of individual autonomy
and the preservation of the marketplace of ideas. By contrast, the Thirteenth
Amendment’s abolitionist purpose would be hindered, not helped, if
people were permitted to sell themselves into slavery.
Extending this approach to the Second Amendment context, it would seem
that the decision not to have or carry arms should be constitutionally protected
if it serves the amendment’s core purpose—individual self-defense, according
to Heller and McDonald v. City of Chicago.
28 That is, if the “core” and “central
component” of the Second Amendment is a right to make decisions about
armed self-defense in the home, and if not possessing guns is one such decision,
then forcing someone to possess a gun amounts to compelled keeping and
violates the amendment’s core purpose.
Part III describes the contours and possible practical import of a right not
to keep or bear arms. Subpart A explores the right not to keep, which, like the
right to keep, would be roughly coextensive with a person’s property rights.
Thus if voluntarily having a gun in one’s home constitutes “keeping” within the
scope of the Second Amendment, then being forced to have a gun in one’s
home constitutes compelled keeping. The latter implicates precisely the same
constitutional interests as the former, because it limits the homeowner’s ability
to make decisions about how best to protect herself using guns and thereby to
prevent violence in her home. This potentially calls into question the constitutionality
of laws compelling private owners or businesses to permit guns on
their property. Whether such laws are actually unconstitutional is difficult to
say—the answer depends among other things on the still-undefined standard of
review for Second Amendment claims—but at the very least they help illustrate
the potential significance of the right not to keep arms.
Subpart B briefly evaluates the right not to bear, which would protect an
individual from being forced to “carry” arms. The practical scope of this right
is limited, if only because the government rarely compels citizens to carry arms
or burdens their ability not to. A right not to bear arms could give rise to

January 2012] RIGHT NOT TO KEEP OR BEAR ARMS 7
Second Amendment arguments—albeit weak and unsuccessful ones—against
compulsory military service. But just as the First Amendment’s right not to
speak does not include an absolute right to refuse to salute one’s commanding
officer, the right not to keep or bear arms would not give soldiers a constitutional
right not to carry weapons.
The purpose of this Article is to test the strengths and weaknesses of an
idea, not to advocate without qualification for the recognition of a new constitutional
right. The idea itself is deeply counterintuitive, and there are serious
objections to it.29 It is not necessarily true that the decision not to keep guns is
the equivalent of self-defense, for example, nor is it obviously correct that being
denied the right to exclude guns from one’s property is the equivalent of
being forced to “keep” them. The Article attempts to address those and other
objections, and by doing so to cast light not only on the idea of a negative
Second Amendment right, but also on the affirmative right of which it may or
may not be a reflection.
The Article takes Heller and McDonald as given, and uses them as departure
points for analysis rather than targets of criticism. The goal here, as in other
post-Heller scholarship,30 is to flesh out the new Second Amendment, and to
determine the implications of a right whose central component and core is selfdefense.
The Article therefore focuses not on the question of whether Heller
and McDonald were rightly decided but rather on the question of their implementation,
a question the Court itself has recognized as largely unanswered.31
The discussion also seeks to highlight a simple but often underappreciated
fact, one that helps explain the bitterness of the political and scholarly debate
over the Second Amendment: both sides are invoking self-defense and personal
safety interests.32 In Heller, the Supreme Court attempted to short-circuit the
 29. One overarching methodological point is worth addressing at the outset. The approach
here is decidedly not originalist, at least inasmuch as it does not rely on historical
evidence that the Framers did or would have specifically rejected laws requiring people to
keep or bear arms in self-defense. (I do, of course, address the conscientious objector exemptions
and the Militia Acts, see infra notes 201, 232-39, and accompanying text, though admittedly
I find it hard to square them with Heller itself, let alone the self-defense framework
explored here.) Those who hope to find originalist evidence as to whether particular contemporary
gun control laws are constitutional may therefore be disappointed, though it should be
noted that Heller itself did not provide any originalist evidence for the gun control measures
it approved. See District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626-27 (2008). Even so, the
analysis here makes every effort to stay within Heller’s framework and to tease out the possible
logical implications of the “central component” of the right the Court found to be rooted
in original understandings.
 30. See, e.g., Volokh, supra note 16.
 31. See Heller, 554 U.S. at 635 (“But since this case represents this Court’s first indepth
examination of the Second Amendment, one should not expect it to clarify the entire
field . . . . And there will be time enough to expound upon the historical justifications for the
exceptions we have mentioned if and when those exceptions come before us.”).

conflict by saying that one side’s policy preferences were irrelevant because the
other had a constitutional right to defend itself with guns. But that did not resolve
the underlying tension, and the growing number of laws that limit private
gun control demonstrate with increasing clarity that if the Second Amendment
is, at its core, a guarantee of self-defense interests, then it may speak to those
who do not want to keep guns as well as those who do. This is not an argument
for gun control, but rather a suggestion that if gun control laws are to be subject
to constitutional scrutiny on the basis that they infringe self-defense interests,
then anti-gun control laws should be as well. Arming one side of the debate
with a constitutional sword means arming the other with a constitutional shield.
I. THE MEANINGS OF “KEEP” AND “BEAR”
The Second Amendment protects a range of individual activity, and yet the
verbs that define that activity—“keep” and “bear”—rarely figure prominently
in legal and popular debates about the amendment’s meaning. Instead, other
words in the amendment—“well-regulated,” “militia,” “the people,” and even
“arms”—generally drive the discussion, with the definitions of “keep” and
“bear” shifting to accommodate them. In Heller, for example, the Court began
its textual analysis with “right of the people,”33 then moved on to “arms,”34 and
only then to the phrases “keep arms”’ and “bear arms.”35 This relative neglect
of the Second Amendment’s major verbs must be remedied, for in order to understand
the scope of the right protected by the amendment, one must know
what actions it covers. Is a person “keeping” a gun when it is stored in a locked
safe in a toolshed? Is he “bearing” it if the gun is in the glove compartment of
his car?36 Understanding the scope of these “affirmative” rights is also necessary
for analyzing the right not to keep or bear. If keeping and bearing are interpreted
broadly, then not-keeping and not-bearing should be as well. If the
right to keep extends to guns that are not in one’s immediate possession, then
the right not to keep should have a similar reach.
These understandings of the Second Amendment’s verbs depend on how
one interprets the amendment as a whole, but it is not the purpose of this Article
to revisit the debate over whether the Second Amendment is solely concerned
with militias, nor even to suggest that one or the other reading of “keep
the equation. . . . Your interest in keeping and bearing a certain firearm may diminish my interest
in being and feeling safe from armed violence.”).

and bear” is preferable. The central holding of Heller, of course, was that the
Second Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms independent
of militia service.37 McDonald affirmed that holding and made it applicable
against the states.38 The argument here accepts Heller and McDonald
as correct and controlling, and refers to the pre-Heller understanding of the
Second Amendment only in order to demonstrate the changes that Heller
brought about. The goal of this Part is to frame the rest of the Article’s argument
by explaining how the central debate over the purpose of the Second
Amendment impacts the meanings of the words “keep” and “bear.”
For present purposes, then, the relevant point is a descriptive one: When
Heller and McDonald shifted the meaning of the Second Amendment away
from militias and toward personal self-defense, they also altered the class of
activities that constitute keeping and bearing. Those who understand the
Second Amendment as protecting a militia-related right read the phrase “keep
and bear arms” to connote the military use of weapons. But under Heller’s “individual
right” reading of the amendment,39 this military understanding is
simply idiomatic. According to the Court’s view, the word “keep” broadly denotes
“having” a gun in one’s home or otherwise constructively possessing it,
while the word “bear” refers to carrying a gun on one’s person.
The new meanings of “keep” and “bear” are important because they indicate
that a new class of individual activity is now protected by the Second
Amendment, and for a different reason than before. It is this shift that makes
the right not to keep or bear arms both constitutionally relevant and practically
important. If the purpose of the Second Amendment were protecting state militias
from disarmament by the federal government, then an individual’s decision
not to keep or bear arms—not to use them in a military sense, that is—would
probably have little constitutional relevance, at least as far as the Second
Amendment is concerned.40 Refusing to bear arms would probably do nothing
to further the amendment’s purpose of protecting state militias from disarmament,
and might even hinder it.
But if the purpose of the Second Amendment is to protect a right to selfdefense,
as Heller and McDonald indicate, then the decision not to keep or bear
arms may have constitutional significance for the simple reason that such a decision
can be, and often is, rooted in concerns about personal safety and selfdefense—values
the Court has now identified as the amendment’s central component.

new definitions for the words “keep” and “bear,” it follows that a right

not to keep or bear—the mirror image of the affirmative right—might have
broad practical implications as well.
A. The Traditional Understanding: Military Terms
Heller’s apparent protestations to the contrary,41 the Second Amendment
was long understood by many if not most courts and scholars to protect state
militias from disarmament by the federal government.42 Under this militiabased
interpretation, the phrase “keep and bear arms” was read as referring to
the possession and use of weapons in connection with militia service.
The word “bear” does the lion’s share of the work in this regard. Adherents
to the militia-based reading of the Second Amendment argue that the phrase’s
plain meaning is military: “The term ‘bear arms’ is a familiar idiom; when used
unadorned by any additional words, its meaning is ‘to serve as a soldier, do
military service, fight.’”43 As historian Gary Wills put it, “To bear arms is, in
itself, a military term. One does not bear arms against a rabbit.”44 This basic
conclusion is buttressed by the fact that “bear” was and is often used in conjunction
with “arms,” creating a combination of words (“bear arms”) that derives
from the Latin arma ferre, which translates directly as bear war equipment.45
Bearing arms therefore had a different meaning from, for example,
bearing guns.46
Supporters of this view point to historical evidence suggesting that the
Framers used “bear arms” to refer to military activity. For example, scholars
 41. See 554 U.S. at 622, 625 (concluding that “nothing in our precedents forecloses
our adoption of the original understanding of the Second Amendment” and that United
States v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), “is not only consistent with, but positively suggests,
that the Second Amendment confers an individual right to keep and bear arms”).
 42. That the militia-based approach was indeed the accepted (even if incorrect) view is
demonstrated in part by the intensity of the reactions, both positive and negative, that Heller
provoked. See, e.g., J. Harvie Wilkinson III, Of Guns, Abortions, and the Unraveling Rule of
Law, 95 VA. L. REV. 253, 254 (2009); Richard A. Posner, In Defense of Looseness: The Supreme
Court and Gun Control, NEW REPUBLIC, Aug. 27, 2008, at 32-35. In any event, the
central argument of this Article does not depend on whether the militia view ever prevailed.
If one believes that Heller was nothing but an affirmation of long-standing and wellrecognized
precedent, then this Subpart may be read as simply a description of what might
have been.

have demonstrated that in Founding-era congressional debates the term “bear
arms” was used almost exclusively to denote military activity.47 Debates over
the wording of the Second Amendment included discussion of whether conscientious
objectors should be exempted from “bearing arms”48 or permitted to
employ others to bear arms in their place.49 Those exceptions make little sense
except in the military context.50 Others have argued that the general public
shared the Framers’ view of the phrase “bear arms” as having a military meaning.
An amicus brief filed by a group of linguists and English professors in Heller
concluded that, out of 115 texts published between the Declaration of Independence
and the adoption of the Second Amendment, the phrase “bear arms”
was used 110 times in a clearly military context, four other times in contexts
that were not clearly military but which included qualifying language conveying
a different meaning, and only once, unadorned, in a nonmilitary context.51
Because it is broader, the meaning of the word “keep” does not support the
militia reading as directly as the word “bear.” Even so, scholars have highlighted
evidence suggesting that it could be, and often was, used to refer to the
maintenance of militia stores. The Articles of Confederation, for example, required
that “every state shall always keep up a well regulated and disciplined
militia, sufficiently armed and accounted, and shall provide and constantly have
ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a
proper quantity of arms, ammunition, and camp equipage.”52 In his Heller dissent,
Justice Stevens pointed to the fact that “a number of state militia laws in
effect at the time of the Second Amendment’s drafting used the term ‘keep’ to
describe the requirement that militia members store their arms at their homes,

ready to be used for service when necessary.”53 Some scholars have bolstered
this view with pre-Framing evidence.54
Finally, many have argued that the phrase “keep and bear arms” is effectively
unitary, which in turn reinforces a militia-based reading of the Second
Amendment. As Justice Stevens put it in his Heller dissent:
[T]he clause protects only one right, rather than two. It does not describe a
right ‘to keep . . . Arms’ and a separate right ‘to bear . . . Arms.’ Rather, the
single right that it does describe is both a duty and a right to have arms available
and ready for military service, and to use them for military purposes when
necessary.
55
The Heller majority rejected this argument, however, treating “keep” and
“bear” as separate verbs protecting different kinds of action. The following
Subpart describes that approach.
B. The New Understanding: Self-Defense Terms
In Heller, the Court held that the Second Amendment protects an “individual”
right to bear arms disconnected from militia service. The majority found
that although “self-defense had little to do with the right’s codification[,] it was
the central component of the right itself.”56 Two Terms later, in McDonald, the
Court reaffirmed this reading and held that the individual right to armed selfdefense
is “among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered
liberty” and is therefore applicable against the states.57
As a textual matter, Heller’s reading of the Second Amendment was based
primarily on the words “right of the people,” which the Court interpreted as referring
to all citizens, not just the select militia.58 But the majority did not ignore
the phrase “keep and bear arms.” Dismissing the traditional militia-related
reading of that phrase as capturing only an “idiomatic” meaning,59 the majority
decoupled the words “keep” and “bear”60 and gave them much broader definitions.
“Keep,” the majority concluded, refers to the act of “possessing” or “having”
a gun, for example, in one’s home.61 “Bear,” meanwhile, means to “carry”

a gun on one’s person.62 Compared to the earlier, militia-related understandings
described above, these definitions extended constitutional protection to a vast
range of private activity.
1. Keeping as having
Whereas supporters of the militia-based reading of the Second Amendment
have traditionally focused on the word “bear,” the Heller majority drew its
strongest support from the word “keep,” which it found to mean “have weapons”:

Johnson defined “keep” as, most relevantly, “[t]o retain; not to lose,” and “[t]o
have in custody.” Webster defined it as “[t]o hold; to retain in one’s power or
possession.” No party has apprised us of an idiomatic meaning of “keep
Arms.” Thus, the most natural reading of “keep Arms” in the Second
Amendment is to “have weapons.”63
The majority supported this conclusion by looking to “written documents
of the founding period,” which it found to show that “‘[k]eep arms’ was simply
a common way of referring to possessing arms, for militiamen and everyone
else.”64
The majority’s reading was in line with that of scholars who argue that
“keep” means to possess. Glenn Harlan Reynolds and Don Kates, for example,
conclude that “the term ‘keep’ refers to owning arms that are kept in one’s
household.”65 Robert E. Shalhope points to the Oxford English Dictionary’s
treatment of the word “keep,” the twenty-ninth definition of which is “actively
to hold in possession; to retain in one’s power or control; to continue to have,
hold, or possess.”66 And Robert H. Churchill argues that “[t]he language of
‘keeping arms’ . . . had a colloquial meaning that applied to individuals outside
of the context of militia service.”67
These scholars invoke historical evidence, often beginning with the 1689
English Bill of Rights, which states in part that “the Subjects which are Protestants
may have Arms for their Defence suitable to their Conditions and as al-

lowed by Law.”68 Some argue that the “have arms” language in the English
Bill of Rights is the precursor to the “keep . . . arms” language in the Second
Amendment, and that Blackstone interpreted the “have arms” protection in
English law as ensuring the “natural right of resistance and selfpreservation”69—a
right to armed self-defense.70 Joyce Lee Malcolm, in her
influential review of the English background of the right to keep and bear arms,
concludes that the English Bill of Rights “came down squarely, and exclusively,
in favour of an individual right to have arms for self-defence.”71
This scholarship, like Heller’s own reasoning, ties the broad definition of
“keep” to a view of the Second Amendment as protecting a right to possess
arms for self-defense. If self-defense in the home is the essence of the right,
then having a gun in one’s home (or in one’s garage, attic, or outdoor shed)
must count as “keeping” it.72
2. Bearing as carrying
The Heller majority’s definition of “bear” was straightforward: “At the
time of the founding, as now, to ‘bear’ meant to ‘carry.’”73 The majority acknowledged
that “bear arms” had an idiomatic military meaning,74 but found
that it was not limited to military service. Instead, the majority concluded that
“[w]hen used with ‘arms,’ . . . the term has a meaning that refers to carrying for
a particular purpose—confrontation.”75 The majority suggested that “confrontation”
can be equated with “offensive or defensive action.”76

setting, while “keep” refers to individual possession in the home. See, e.g., Kates, supra
note 65, at 219 (concluding that “‘bear’ did generally refer to the carrying of arms by militiamen,”
while “‘keep’ was commonly used in colonial and early state statutes to describe
arms possession by individuals in all contexts, not just in relation to militia service”).

Justice Scalia’s opinion for the Court conducted a “review of founding-era
sources,” from which it “conclude[d] that this natural meaning was also the
meaning that ‘bear arms’ had in the 18th century. In numerous instances, ‘bear
arms’ was unambiguously used to refer to the carrying of weapons outside of
an organized militia.”77 The Court discounted the evidence, presented in amicus
briefs by linguists and historians, that “bear arms” was most often used in
the military context: “[T]he fact that the phrase was commonly used in a particular
context does not show that it is limited to that context, and, in any event,
we have given many sources where the phrase was used in nonmilitary contexts.”78
In his opinion below for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals striking
down the District of Columbia’s gun regulations, Judge Silberman reached a
similar conclusion, writing that “the public understanding of ‘bear Arms’ also
encompassed the carrying of arms for private purposes such as self-defense.”79
Many gun-rights scholars agree, pointing to Patrick Henry’s statement that
“[t]he great object is that every man be armed. . . . Every one who is able may
have a gun,” and arguing that Henry’s statement equates bearing arms with
having guns, rather than with military service.80
The examples and citations could be multiplied, but already two elements
of Heller’s rationale are apparent: first, that the core of the Second Amendment
right is self-defense; and second, that the words “keep” and “bear” must be interpreted
with that central purpose in mind. The former principle stands out not
only through the Court’s general framework of analysis, but through its explicit
holding that the core of the Second Amendment is “the right of law-abiding,
responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home.”81 Indeed, despite
noting that “self-defense had little to do with the [arms-bearing] right’s

codification,” the majority concluded that self-defense was “the central component
of the right itself” because the Second Amendment was “widely understood
to codify a pre-existing right, rather than to fashion a new one.”82 That
preexisting right, deriving from Blackstone’s “natural right of resistance and
self-preservation,”83 amounted to an “individual right to use arms for selfdefense.”84
But Heller does not simply reaffirm the traditional right to act in selfdefense
when threatened. Rather, it recognizes a right to have and carry guns in
case the need for such an action should arise. In other words, the activity protected
by Heller—the possession and carrying of guns—is not itself an act of
self-defense, but a means of enabling such acts. Accordingly, the “self-defense”
constitutionalized in Heller is not simply the traditional conception of resisting
an attack, but something more like a right to make self-defense-related decisions
regarding guns. Because this right can be exercised even when no personal
threat is imminent, it is in many ways broader than the traditional conception
of self-defense.85 But as with traditional acts of self-defense, the Court emphasized
that the right to arm oneself against potential future threats has special salience
within the home.86 Of course, the precise implications of that reading
remain murky. Is the Second Amendment’s self-defense right limited to guns
and other “arms,” or does it constitutionalize the entire common law right to
self-defense?87 Are all personal safety decisions now protected by the Second
Amendment?88 The answer to the latter question, at least, must surely be no.

January 2012] RIGHT NOT TO KEEP OR BEAR ARMS 17
decisions, this Article limits it to the decision of whether to keep or bear a gun
in self-defense.
The second notable element of Heller’s rationale is the idea that “keep”
and “bear” must be interpreted in line with this self-defense purpose. Since
Heller and McDonald reinterpreted the Second Amendment as protecting a
right of the people to keep and bear arms in self-defense, courts and scholars
have begun the difficult task of defining which guns count as “arms,”89 which
people count as “the people,”90 and what kinds of regulations of each are permissible.91
They have often done so by referring to the self-defense values underlying
the amendment. For example, the Heller majority held that the Second
Amendment protects only the types of “arms” that are commonly used for
“lawful purposes like self-defense.”92 Handguns, the Court found, fall within
this definition because they are the “most popular weapon chosen by Americans
for self-defense in the home.”93
It stands to reason that courts and scholars will take a similar approach
when defining “keep” and “bear.” Heller indicates that the words should be interpreted
broadly, but how much so? If a person has a pistol in her office, or
locked in a safe, or stored in a toolshed, is she “keeping” it even though it is not
immediately available for self-defense? If she places a gun in the glove box of
her car, is she “bearing” it?94 What is clear is that the words “keep” and “bear”
no longer refer to the possession and use of weapons in connection with military
service. Instead, they refer to broad rights of personal possession for purposes
of self-defense.
Although many important questions remain to be answered, the debates described
above demonstrate a changing trajectory of meaning, one that points in
the direction of private self-defense uses but whose precise implications remain
unclear. Those uses, in turn, are rooted in and defined by the core and central
component of the Second Amendment: self-defense. Knowing that, one can be-

 90. The majority gestured towards an all-expansive definition of “the people,” but also
denied the right to certain groups of people, including felons and the mentally ill. See District
of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626-27 (2008); see also United States v. PortilloMunoz,

II. RIGHTS NOT TO
Sometimes, but not always, a constitutional right to do something is accompanied
by a right not to do that thing. This Article refers to these rights—
which guarantee both X and not-X—as “choice rights.”95 The purpose of this
Part is not to give a complete account of and justification for these rights, but
rather to make some observations about how they might be separated from other,
take-it-or-leave-it rights—those that constitutionally guarantee a right to engage
in a particular activity, without a corresponding right not to do so. This
initial foray suggests that choice rights arise where the constitutional values
underlying the right are furthered by protecting the decision whether to engage
in the enumerated activity, and not simply by protecting the activity itself. In
other words, a right to do X encompasses a right not to do X where the principles
justifying the right to do X also justify the right not to do X.
96
A. The Right Not to Speak
In order to provide a useful comparator for the right not to keep or bear
arms, this Subpart first explores the right not to speak, the closest and most familiar
cousin of the right not to keep or bear arms.97 Because it permits individuals
to decide whether to speak, the First Amendment creates what this Article
calls a choice right. The existence and contours of that right are tied
directly to underlying First Amendment values like individual autonomy and
the marketplace of ideas. This suggests that not-X rights can spring from the
rationales and purposes of X rights.
In West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, the Supreme Court
found that schoolchildren have a First Amendment right not to salute the flag or
say the Pledge of Allegiance.98 Justice Jackson gave a characteristically quotable
justification for this right: “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional
constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox
in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion or force citizens
to confess by word or act their faith therein.”99 That basic idea—indeed
 95. In Rights To and Not To, I explore the concept of choice rights in more detail,
along with their counterparts “option rights” (rights to X, but not not-X) and “protection
rights” (rights to not-X, but not X). See Blocher, supra note 15.
 96. I argue in Rights To and Not To that this is not the only way that choice rights
come about. See id.

that very passage—has been a pillar of First Amendment jurisprudence for almost
seventy years,100 despite the fact that the amendment’s text says nothing
specifically about a right or freedom not to speak.
The other leading case in the compelled speech canon arose more than thirty
years later. In Wooley v. Maynard,
101 two Jehovah’s Witnesses objected to
having the New Hampshire state motto (“Live Free or Die”) emblazoned on
their cars’ license plates. Prosecuted for covering the motto with tape, they argued
that requiring them to display it violated their First Amendment rights by
compelling them to endorse a message they did not support. The Supreme
Court agreed, finding that the state law impermissibly required individuals to
“use their private property as a ‘mobile billboard’ for the State’s ideological
message.”102
In both Barnette and Wooley, the Court held that private parties were
shielded by the First Amendment from being required to engage in activities—
expressive conduct—that undoubtedly would have been constitutionally protected
had they been done voluntarily. The Court has taken a similar approach
in cases involving what is often called “compelled subsidization.”103 In Abood
v. Detroit Board of Education,
104 for example, teachers argued that they had a
First Amendment right not to have their legally required union fees spent on
various union activities they did not support. Such an arrangement, they
claimed, violated their right to free speech by forcing them to pay for speech
they did not support.105 The Supreme Court agreed, holding that “in a free society
one’s beliefs should be shaped by his mind and his conscience rather than
coerced by the State.”106 Had the teachers paid dues for the union’s political
activities voluntarily, they surely would have been engaged in protected speech.
That the dues were required did not change the nature of the activity as speech;
it simply made it compelled rather than free.
The existence of the right not to speak raises an obvious but difficult question:
why protect such a right? The reasons for prohibiting compelled speech

are diverse and contested, but no more or less so than those for protecting
speech itself. In fact, they mirror each other, for the simple reason that the freedom
to speak and the freedom not to speak protect the same constitutional values,
whether those are thought to derive from autonomy, the marketplace of
ideas, or something else entirely. The reasons for banning compelled speech
therefore track the reasons for protecting speech itself. First and perhaps most
prominently, the right not to speak has been conceptualized as a means of protecting
individual autonomy or self-realization, which in turn has long been
considered a core component of the “affirmative” right to speak.107 In Hurley v.
Irish-American Gay, Lesbian & Bisexual Group of Boston, Justice Souter’s
opinion for the Court made this connection, concluding that compelled speech
“violates the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment, that a
speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.”108 Similarly,
in Wooley, the Court emphasized that the state’s interests did not outweigh
“the right of individuals to hold a point of view different from the majority
and to refuse to foster . . . an idea they find morally objectionable.”109 As in
Barnette, the emphasis was on the individual’s right to refuse, not necessarily
on how the marketplace of ideas would or would not be impacted by compelled
expression.110
The individual autonomy rationale has also found favor in scholarly efforts
to identify and explain the harms caused by compelled speech. Thomas Emerson,
for example, wrote that “[t]he full protection extended to the right of belief
in the Barnette case is essential to an effective system of freedom of expression.
Forcing public expression of a belief is an affront to personal integrity.”111
Seana Shiffrin argues that the result in Barnette “does not depend on
any external effect,” but rather on “the illicit influence compelled speech may
have on the character and autonomous thinking process of the compelled
speaker.”112 Others conclude that compelled expression “infringe[s] upon what
may be called the individual’s interest in selfhood”113 and that “[t]he protection
against compelled expression is grounded primarily in concerns for individual
liberty underlying freedom of speech.”114 The examples could be multiplied,115
107. See, e.g., Martin H. Redish, The Value of Free Speech, 130 U. PA. L. REV. 591,

but their import is clear—the autonomy rationale has been a dominant theme of
compelled speech theory and doctrine.
Another way to conceptualize the doctrine is by considering how compelled
speech harms not just the individual who is forced to speak, but the marketplace
of ideas as a whole.116 The marketplace, after all, has been a guiding
metaphor of First Amendment jurisprudence for almost a century now,117 despite
heavy criticism.118 The metaphor is generally traced to Justice Holmes’s
famous statement that “the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get
itself accepted in the competition of the market.”119 This suggests that speech
has instrumental value because it is the best available mechanism for sorting
good ideas from bad. Compelled speech threatens to distort that marketplace in
a variety of ways. By forcing people to say things they do not believe, it gives
prominence to ideas based not on how well they are “accepted in the competition
of the market”120 but on whether they are favored by the relevant government
officials.121 That is, the basic principle of the marketplace of ideas is that
people’s individual, autonomous decisions will eventually sort good ideas from
bad. When people are not free to make those decisions, the marketplace itself
malfunctions.122
The marketplace argument against compelled speech has made occasional
appearances in the Court’s free speech decisions. Justice Black wrote in dissent
in Barenblatt v. United States, “It is this right, the right to err politically, which
keeps us strong as a Nation. . . . It is these interests of society, rather than Barenblatt’s
own right to silence, which I think the Court should put on the balance
against the demands of the Government, if any balancing process is to be
115. See, e.g., Caroline Mala Corbin, The First Amendment Right Against Compelled
Listening, 89 B.U. L. REV. 939, 978 (2009) (“Nor can the capacity for self-realization and
self-determination, both central to our notion of human autonomy, flourish if the state injects
itself into our thought processes.”).
116. See, e.g., id. at 979 (“Compelled speech also distorts the marketplace of ideas and
democratic decision-making by misrepresenting the views of speakers forced to propound a
viewpoint that is not their own.”).

Justification, 30 GA. L. REV. 1, 1 (1995) (“In Speech Clause jurisprudence, . . . the oftrepeated

to ultimately prevail over falsity has been virtually canonized.”).

tolerated.”123 The marketplace distortion rationale takes on special weight in
compelled subsidy cases like Abood v. Detroit Board of Education.
124 By requiring
people to support speech with which they do not agree, compelled subsidies
distort the marketplace of ideas just as surely as it would distort the realworld
marketplace if businesses were required to financially subsidize their
competitors.
The point of this short excursion into First Amendment theory and doctrine
is simply to show that the right to avoid compelled speech has often been justified
for the same reasons as the right to speak.125 C. Edwin Baker, for example,
argued that “respect for individual integrity and autonomy requires the recognition
that a person has the right to use speech to develop herself or to influence
or interact with others in a manner that corresponds to her values.”126 He similarly
concluded that “respect for the integrity and autonomy of the individual
usually requires giving each person at least veto power over the use of her own
body and, similarly, over her own speech.”127 Martin Redish has argued that
free speech should be protected in part because of individual autonomy interests,128
and that compelled speech interferes with this autonomy by interfering
with the capacity for critical analysis.129 Similar symmetries emerge in the
works of other scholars who have grappled with the problem of compelled
speech.130
Because First Amendment jurisprudence and theory are relatively wellelaborated,
they provide a useful illustrative example of how courts and scholars
have derived negative rights from affirmative ones by looking to the rights’
underlying purposes. Free speech doctrine, in turn, has often served as a guide
for Second Amendment questions. Indeed, “[a]nalogies between the First
Amendment and the Second (and comparable state constitutional protections)

125. One can imagine First Amendment rationales that would not create a choice right
with regard to speech. If the amendment’s purpose were simply to increase the sum total of
“speech,” then compelled speech might not be a First Amendment problem (although it
might still violate other constitutional provisions, like the “liberty” protected by the Fourteenth
Amendment).

are over 200 years old.”131 In Heller itself, the Court invoked the analogy repeatedly
and at some length.132 There are undoubtedly many reasons why the
comparison has proven so attractive. The amendments’ proximity in the Bill of
Rights might be relevant, as is the fact that both seem to have special cachet in
the American political and social imagination. Gun rights advocates in particular
have long relied on free speech analogies in arguing that the Second
Amendment, like the First, covers an “individual” right entitled to strong judicial
protection. For this Article, the analogy is especially useful for the simple
reason that the First and Second Amendments—unlike, say, the Equal Protection
Clause—directly guarantee the right to engage in an activity.
But the argument here does not depend on whether the First and Second
Amendments are comparable in all respects; it simply uses the First as an exemplar
of how “rights not to” can be identified. This Subpart has tried to show
that when the underlying constitutional values—whether derived from individual
autonomy, marketplace of ideas, or some other principle—are furthered by
both positive and negative invocations of the right, individuals have a constitutionally
protected right to choose whether to speak. As the following Subpart
explains, the same symmetries emerge in other areas of constitutional law, including
the Second Amendment.
B. Other Rights Not To
Free speech is not the only area of theory or doctrine to recognize choice
rights. Religious practice provides a particularly interesting example, because
the Court has held that the Free Exercise Clause, standing alone, prohibits the
government from compelling individuals to engage in religious activity.133 The
First Amendment’s freedom of association provides another useful example,
for as the Court has noted, “[f]reedom of association . . . plainly presupposes a

CASE AGAINST GUN CONTROL 25 (Cato Inst., Policy Analysis No. 109, 1988) (arguing that
the Second Amendment, like the First, should be read to prohibit registration requirements);
sources cited supra note 16.
132. See, e.g., District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 595 (2008) (“Thus, we do
not read the Second Amendment to protect the right of citizens to carry arms for any sort of
confrontation, just as we do not read the First Amendment to protect the right of citizens to
speak for any purpose.”); id. at 582 (“Just as the First Amendment protects modern forms of
communications, . . . the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that
constitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.”).
133. See Emp’t Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 877 (1990) (holding that the Free Exercise
Clause prohibits the government from, among other things, “compel[ling] affirmation of religious
beliefs”). Of course, the Establishment Clause may effectively do the same thing. See
Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 433 (1962) (holding that compelled prayer in schools violates
the Establishment Clause); Everson v. Bd. of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1947) (citing the Establishment
Clause for the proposition that “[n]o person can be punished for entertaining or
professing religious beliefs or disbeliefs, for church attendance or non-attendance”). 
BLOCHER 64 STAN. L. REV. 1 (DO NOT DELETE) 1/14/2012 6:42 PM

freedom not to associate.”134 Were it otherwise, expressive and intimate associations
could not manage their membership and would for that very reason
cease to be expressive. A group with no control over its membership, after all,
has little chance of effectively expressing its members’ views.135 And once
again, it emerges that the affirmative and negative versions of the activity—
association and nonassociation—receive similar protection for the simple reason
that they both advance the values of freedom of association: the ability of a
group to control and express its message to the outside world,136 and to control
the values and ideals that it cultivates in its members.137
The association example also highlights an interesting difficulty with the
very idea of “rights to” and “rights not to.” Given the intertwined relationship
between association and nonassociation, perhaps there is no difference between
the two. Perhaps refusal to associate is simply an exercise of the right to associate,
rather than a derivative right not to. That is, if it is true that the right not
to associate is necessary to a meaningful right of association, then it might
make sense to collapse nonassociation back into the “affirmative” right. This is
in large part an issue of semantics, and it might be a good thing to allow the
merger for the sake of simplicity. One could read this Article as addressing a
particular (negative) manner of arms-bearing, for example. And yet association
and nonassociation are inextricably linked not because they are the same action—admitting
and rejecting a member of a group are not the same thing, nor
are speech and silence or carrying and not carrying a gun—but because they
serve the same constitutional values.
But of course the Constitution does not protect a generalized right to “autonomy,”
nor does it prohibit all government actions that limit people’s ability
to do as they please or require them to do things they would rather not. More
specifically, not all “rights to” have corresponding “rights not to,” even if the
rights themselves can be waived. As the Court has noted, “[t]he ability to waive
a constitutional right does not ordinarily carry with it the right to insist upon the
opposite of that right.”138 The right to a jury trial,139 for example, is generally
134. Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984); see also Boy Scouts of Am. v.
Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 648 (2000) (noting that government actions that could potentially burden
the freedom of association include “‘intrusion into the internal structure or affairs of an
association’ like a ‘regulation that forces the group to accept members it does not desire.’”
(citing Roberts, 468 U.S. at 623)).
135. See, e.g., Boy Scouts, 530 U.S. at 648 (“Forcing a group to accept certain members
may impair the ability of the group to express those views, and only those views, that it intends
to express.”).

of the Nation by cultivating and transmitting shared ideals and beliefs”).

waivable. But that does not mean that a person has a right to proceed without a
jury.140 Similarly, the right to a speedy trial does not protect a generalized freedom
to determine the speed of one’s trial,141 nor does the right to a public trial
“guarantee the right to compel a private trial.”142
Most courts and scholars have given no sustained attention to the relationship
between rights to and rights not to as a general matter, focusing instead on
specific rights like speech and association. The notable exception is John Garvey,
who has argued forcefully and at length that rights should usually be conceptualized
as “one-way streets” rather than as “two-way streets”:
Suppose that it is good to do x. That does not mean that it is good not to do x.
If freedom follows the good, we should be free to do x. But that does not mean
that we should be free not to do x. The goodness of religion (or childbearing)
does not entail the goodness of atheism (or abortion).143
It follows, Garvey argues, that rights should generally be understood to operate
in only one direction—the direction of “the good.” But Garvey himself
notes that this argument goes against the grain of current constitutional thinking,
which tends to see rights as bilateral.144
Perhaps more importantly, even Garvey’s skeptical approach to two-way
rights turns on whether the values or purposes underlying the right suggest the
existence of a right not to.145 Under this approach, whether the right to keep
and bear arms encompasses a right not to keep and bear arms depends on what
values, purposes, “core,”146 or “central component”147 one attributes to the
right. This is why the free speech right includes a right not to speak, as Part
II.A explains, but the right to a speedy trial does not include a right to a slow
one. The key question, then, is whether and how the purpose of the Second
Amendment implies a negative right. The next Part addresses that question in
detail.

III. THE RIGHT NOT TO KEEP OR BEAR ARMS
As Part I explained, Heller holds that the central component and core of the
Second Amendment right is self-defense,148 suggests that the right is especially
strong in the home, and interprets the words “keep” and “bear” with an aim toward
enabling self-defense.149 Part II then set up a question: is that core value—like
the First Amendment values discussed above—furthered by the recognition
of a right not to keep or bear arms? This final Part attempts to provide
an answer. It first sketches the outlines of a right not to keep or bear arms and
considers a few of the strongest arguments against it. Parts III.A and III.B consider
in more detail the rights not to keep and not to bear, along with some examples
of current laws for which they might be relevant. Part III.C takes a
broad view of the competing interests at stake.
A person who keeps a gun in her home for self-defense does so in order to
enable self-protection against certain kinds of threats to personal safety: criminals,
for example. She has presumably concluded that her home is safer with a
gun than without one. But many people who refuse to keep guns have come to
the opposite conclusion based on their assessment of other possible threats to
personal safety such as misuse, accidental or otherwise, of the gun. Insofar as
both of these are covered by the broad concept of “self-defense” employed in
Heller—a contestable proposition, to be sure—both seem to fall within the core
of the Second Amendment. And if self-defense is the “central component” of
the Second Amendment right, it seems odd that self-defense decisions should
only be constitutionally protected when they are effectuated with a gun, rather
than threatened by one. In either case, the goal of the person making the decision
is to limit a risk of future harm. Indeed, even the affirmative Second
Amendment right does not directly involve acts of self-defense, but rather the
freedom to have certain means available to protect oneself against certain kinds
of harm. Laws that compel people to have guns in their homes simply interfere
with that decision in a different direction.
This sketch of the right not to keep or bear arms is subject to a wide range
of criticisms. The most serious objection is that the decision not to possess
guns, while perhaps a safety decision, is not an exercise of the right to selfdefense.
Traditionally, self-defense generally refers to the use of force in response
to an immediate threat to personal safety,150 and avoiding the remote
possibility of a gun’s misuse is not the same kind of “self-defense” as brandishing
a weapon against an intruder. This is a strong and deceptively complex objection,
but not necessarily a fatal one.

January 2012] RIGHT NOT TO KEEP OR BEAR ARMS 27
It is true that declining to possess a gun is not a traditional act of selfdefense,
unless perhaps it is done under the apprehension of immediate harm—
if a person were to refuse to brandish a gun while visiting the White House, for
example, on the grounds that doing so might provoke the Secret Service to
shoot him. Rather, the decision not to keep a gun is a kind of preventative act,
one intended to lessen the risk of future harm. But in this respect, it is not so
different from gun ownership itself, which falls within Heller’s “core” even
though it is not in and of itself an ongoing act of self-defense. In either case, a
person has made a decision to protect himself against the possibility of future
harm, whether it be crime or misuse of a gun. The gun owner has determined
that his chances of safety are maximized if he keeps a gun. His neighbor without
a gun has made a different calculation.
And yet it is possible that having a gun in order to defend oneself against
burglars should count as self-defense, while the prevention of other forms of
violence by not keeping or having a gun should not. That is, one must ask
whether the core purpose of the Second Amendment protects efforts to avoid
violence by keeping a gun, but does not protect efforts to avoid other forms of
(perhaps accidental) violence through not having a gun. The answer is not obvious.
On the one hand, it cannot be the case that the Second Amendment includes
a generalized right to “personal safety,” which individuals can invoke
against any government action that makes them feel unsafe. On the other hand,
subjecting another person to a risk of future violence or other harm—
brandishing a weapon at him or planting potential explosives in his home, for
example—can give rise to tort or criminal liability.151 Why, then, should efforts
to avoid such risks and harms not count as self-defense?
Second Amendment self-defense is not coextensive with “self-defense” as
that term is used in other areas of law. Its “core” includes actions—keeping a
gun, for example—that are not themselves acts of self-defense and might never
even lead to acts of self-defense. Similarly, the Second Amendment has been
read to extend protection against threats that fall outside the traditional conception
of self-defense. Many scholars believe that Second Amendment selfdefense
should include self-defense against not only criminals, but the government
itself,152 and perhaps even nonhuman threats. At oral argument in Heller,
Justice Kennedy referred to “the concern of the remote settler to defend himself
151. See id. § 21 (“The crime of reckless endangerment is committed when a defendant
commits an act that places another in imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury
. . . .”); id. § 39 (“If pointing a firearm places the victim in reasonable apprehension of
receiving bodily injury, the crime of aggravated assault has been committed, regardless of
whether the gun was loaded.”).

was meant to protect the right to keep and bear arms to resist tyranny—as the Heller Court

and his family against hostile Indian tribes and outlaws, wolves and bears and
grizzlies and things like that.”153
Since the concept of self-defense lying at the heart of the Second Amendment
encompasses decisions about whether arms-bearing will be useful in responding
to threats that are neither present nor imminent, it seems plausible that
the concept would also cover those risks arising from gun ownership itself. The
exact scope of these risks is debatable, but not negligible. Some studies show
that “[a] gun in the home is more likely to be used in a homicide, suicide, or
unintentional shooting than to be used in self-defense.”154 Others have found
that “about eight hundred people per year die from unintentional gunshot injuries.”155
According to a 1991 General Accounting Office study, “[f]irearms are
the fourth leading cause of accidental deaths among children 5 to 14 years old
and the third leading cause of accidental deaths among 15- to 24-year-olds.
Across all age groups, accidental shootings are the sixth leading cause of potential
years of life lost because of accidents.”156 And some homeowners might
believe that keeping guns will make them a target for criminals—half a million
guns are stolen every year157—or increase the chances that any crime they suffer
will turn violent.
The accuracy and significance of these figures are deeply disputed,158 and
it is not the purpose of this Article to suggest that they are correct or should be
persuasive. But as far as the Constitution is concerned, whether a person believes
them or not should presumably be irrelevant—“the Second Amendment

In addition, suicides account for approximately half of all firearm-related deaths, although
they often are not central to the gun control debate. Limiting access to guns can arguably
reduce the number of impulse suicide attempts, and reduce the fatality of those suicide
attempts that do occur (thus saving lives, since only ten percent of people who survive a first
suicide attempt eventually die of suicide). See Matthew Miller & David Hemenway, Guns

is meant to constitutionally mandate skepticism about public safety arguments,”159
whether in support of gun ownership or against it. This is precisely
why the Heller majority explicitly rejected Justice Breyer’s invocation of statistics
regarding accidental shootings.160 If the freedom to keep and bear arms
protects a person’s decision to discount those statistics and conclude that he is
safer with a gun in the home than without one, then it stands to reason that
another person should be equally free to believe the statistics and make the opposite
choice. After all, only a quarter of the adult population owns guns,161
and only a minority of those who do own guns say they do so for the primary
purpose of self-defense.162 There are therefore tens and perhaps even hundreds
of millions of Americans who do not own guns, and according to at least one
group of scholars, “about two-thirds of gunless adults were actively opposed to
having guns in their homes because they viewed guns as dangerous, ‘immoral,’
or otherwise objectionable.”163 If, as Heller suggests, the “reliance of millions
of Americans” on the individual rights reading of the Second Amendment is
relevant to the amendment’s interpretation,164 then it stands to reason that the
reliance of millions more Americans on the freedom not to keep arms should be
as well.
The relationship between self-defense and personal safety in the context of
the Second Amendment is therefore extremely complicated. If the former is defined
at too high a level of generality, then it could encompass all decisions regarding
personal safety or well-being. The argument here attempts to avoid that
problem by focusing, as the Second Amendment does, on safety decisions regarding
“arms,” and by tying the right not to bear arms to the same reasons that
underlie the affirmative right. That mitigates the problem, but admittedly does
not address it fully. Rights, after all, are not necessarily coextensive with their
background justifications. Heller itself found that although “self-defense had
little to do with the right’s codification[,] it was the central component of the
right itself.”165 Defining precisely which activities are tied to the background
justification is no easy task, and it is surely not fully accomplished here. But
that is a difficulty common to many constitutional rights. Courts and scholars

often confront the question of what counts as speech, for example, and they
continue to explore the ramifications of Heller’s self-defense rationale for affirmative
Second Amendment rights.166
A second objection would reject the very notion of a Second Amendment
autonomy right by saying that even if a right to X includes a right to not-X
where the principles justifying the former also justify the latter, the Second
Amendment’s own principles do no such thing. One might argue that the purpose
of the Second Amendment is to ensure military readiness, or to deter tyranny
and crime through the maintenance of an armed citizenry. All of these
readings would suggest that the Second Amendment right—like that to a jury
trial—serves a public interest as well as a private one,167 and therefore that its
value goes beyond its utility for individuals. If that is so, then it might follow
that the amendment does not include a negative right (and perhaps should not
even be waivable).
But this objection is hard to square with Heller and McDonald. As explained
at length in Part I, the Court identified personal self-defense as the core
and central component of the Second Amendment,168 and defined the terms of
the amendment in accordance with that interpretation. It seems to follow that
whatever value arms-bearing has for public purposes like militia service must
be subordinate to that self-defense purpose. And it is hard to imagine how selfdefense,
particularly in the home, serves public values that would override individual
decisionmaking, particularly in light of the Court’s apparent rejection
of public safety rationales in Heller.
169 If public safety is not a sufficient basis
for limiting the affirmative right, then neither should it be a basis for rejecting
the negative right. In short, whatever the plausibility of a public value interpretation
of personal self-defense, it does not seem consistent with Heller itself.
The objection does highlight, however, the dependence of the negative right on
the purpose of its affirmative cousin. If the militia-based reading of the Second
Amendment had prevailed, no negative right would be apparent, because the
refusal to keep or bear arms hinders, rather than helps, the purpose of protecting
the militia from disarmament.
A third objection might take a textualist approach, arguing that the Second
Amendment’s phrasing creates a one-way right: after all, “the First Amendment

guarantees ‘freedom of speech,’ a term necessarily comprising the decision of
both what to say and what not to say,”170 while the Second Amendment refers
only to “the right to keep and bear arms.” It arguably follows that a person can
defend himself with a gun and gain the Second Amendment’s protection, or
else defend himself by some other means (by not having a gun, for example)
and forfeit that constitutional protection.
This textualist argument has some appeal, but it does not square particularly
well with existing constitutional doctrine, which does not determine the existence
of rights to and not to based solely or even primarily on the text alone.
The Free Exercise Clause, for example, provides that “Congress shall make no
law . . . prohibiting the free exercise” of religion.171 That phrasing, like the
Second Amendment’s, seems to point in only one direction—that of exercise.172
And yet the Court has held that the Free Exercise Clause prohibits
compelled religious activity.173 Without more, it seems difficult to draw a
bright line between enumerated “freedoms” and “rights.”
A. The Right Not to “Keep” Arms
Even if one accepts that the Second Amendment theoretically protects a
right not to keep arms, it remains to be shown what scope that right should have
in practice. Because of the symmetry of the constitutional interests involved in
keeping and not keeping, it makes sense that the right not to keep should, prima
facie, extend as far as the right to keep. Thus if a particular act of “keeping” is
constitutionally protected when done voluntarily, it should be constitutionally
suspect when it is compelled. Having a gun on one’s bedside table, for example,
would be a constitutionally protected act of “keeping” when done voluntarily,
and a constitutionally prohibited violation of the right not to keep when it
is compelled.
To put it more precisely, the Second Amendment right not to keep guns
should be coextensive with one’s property-based right to exclude them. Indeed,
it is that very property right that is limited or taken away by the anti-gun control
laws described in the following Subparts. Were it not for those laws, private
parties would be free to reach their own arrangements regarding the keeping
or bearing of arms. The right to keep guns or not would encompass a zone
of autonomy in which individuals are free to make either decision, for both involve
the same self-defense interests. The Second Amendment would be impli-

cated only when the government forbids people from keeping or bearing arms
or forces them to do so.
Perhaps a hypothetical will be illustrative.174 A handgun is lying on an end
table in Jon’s living room. Does its presence represent an exercise of Second
Amendment rights? If Jon owns the gun and placed it there so that it would be
easily accessible in case of a home invasion, then it is covered by the Hellerrecognized
right to armed self-defense in the home. This is true whether or not
the gun is in Jon’s immediate vicinity at any given time. If he leaves the gun on
the end table while he goes to the kitchen to make dinner, he is still “keeping”
it as far as the Second Amendment is concerned.
Now alter the scenario. The gun on the end table belongs to Jon’s friend
Brad, who carries it for self-defense and left it on Jon’s living room table while
the two are eating dinner in Jon’s kitchen. In this scenario, Jon believes that
guns are dangerous, and that having them in his home imperils his personal
safety. Holding aside for the moment Jon’s property-based right to exclude
Brad and his gun,175 what self-defense rights are at work? On the one hand,
Brad may argue that he is exercising his own Second Amendment rights, and
that the gun is a mechanism of self-defense for him even when he is “keeping”
it on Jon’s end table rather than on his own person. That is, after all, the same
argument that Jon made in the first scenario, and the gun in the second scenario
is just as accessible to Brad as it is to Jon. But what about Jon? If having a gun
on his end table counts as “keeping” when he does it voluntarily, why should it
be anything else when he is forced to do so? The very things that make the gun
a useful mechanism of self-defense when it is lying on the end table also make
it the kind of dangerous implement that Jon wants to keep out of his home.
Jon’s ability to keep himself safe, in other words, is imperiled by the presence
of the gun in this scenario, just as it was protected in the first one. Why
shouldn’t he have precisely the same self-defense rights in each scenario?
There are many ways to distinguish the former scenario from the latter, but
none is very satisfying. An obvious move is to challenge the very idea of compelled
keeping. One might say, for example, that the concept of keeping implies
voluntariness, and that it is therefore impossible for a person to be compelled
to keep a weapon. Under this approach, Jon is not keeping a gun in the
second scenario for the simple reason that he has not chosen to do so. But this
argument is unsatisfactory, just as it would have been unsatisfactory for the Supreme
Court to have told the Barnette children that speaking is a voluntary act,
and that they therefore need not worry about their First Amendment rights being
violated by an obligatory pledge. In either situation, the essence of the
174. Because my goal here is simply to illustrate the meanings of keeping and notkeeping,
the hypothetical involves no state action. But as Parts III.A, III.B, and III.C demonstrate,
some incidents of state action implicate the same issues.
175. This is, of course, the very right limited by the anti-gun control laws discussed below,
which is why it must be held aside for now. 
BLOCHER 64 STAN. L. REV. 1 (DO NOT DELETE) 1/14/2012 6:42 PM

claim is that individuals have a constitutionally protected right to choose
whether to engage in the action. It is not enough to define the action in such a
way as to avoid that claim.
A more fundamental objection would challenge the concept of compelled
constructive keeping. In criminal law, constructive possession usually requires
presence of an object, knowledge of that object, and ability and intent to exercise
control over it.176 It is effectively “a legal fiction used by courts to find
possession in situations where it does not in fact exist, but where they nevertheless
want an individual to acquire the legal status of a possessor.”177 These
elements are interrelated—some courts (though by no means a majority) have
recognized that “proximity of the defendant to a firearm may be a basis for
conviction of the ‘use’ prong so long as there is some active employment of the
firearm,”178 and “[w]hen a defendant has exclusive possession of the premises
on which a firearm is found, knowledge, dominion, and control can be properly
inferred because of the exclusive possession alone.”179 Questions of constructive
possession have already arisen in post-Heller cases, most often where a
gun owner shares a home with someone who is barred from having a gun—a
felon, for example. In such cases, the gun owner who is not a felon may be
wary about being prosecuted for aiding and abetting a felon in possession on
the theory that the felon with whom he shares a home constructively possesses
the weapons inside it.180 But one might nonetheless argue that the scenarios
suggested here involve only the unwanted presence of a gun, not necessarily
the knowledge of the homeowner who wants to exclude it, and certainly no
ability to exercise control over it. Therefore, if anything, Jon has suffered a
trespass, rather than compelled possession.181

that proximity, accessibility, or control over the relevant area is sufficient to show
constructive possession. See Kimberly J. Winbush, What Constitutes “Constructive Possession”

34 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 64:1
Certainly, it may be counterintuitive that being denied the right to exclude
guns from one’s property is the equivalent of being forced to “keep” them. But
that concern implicates the reach of the right, not its fundamental soundness. It
seems intuitively correct, for example, that being specifically required to have a
gun on one’s bedside table constitutes compelled keeping, while living in the
same apartment building with a gun owner does not. The issue, then, is how
broadly “not keeping” and “not bearing” should be interpreted, a question tied
to the Supreme Court’s apparently broad reading of “keep” as “have.” If the affirmative
Second Amendment right extends to closets, safes, attics, and other
incidents of nonimmediate possession, then it is not clear why the negative
right should have a narrower reach, particularly when the right to self-defense
in the home is implicated either way. After all, if a gun is accessible enough to
be useful for self-defense, it is almost inevitably accessible enough to pose
safety risks. The right to determine whether the benefits outweigh the risks is
the freedom protected by the constitutionalized right to self-defense.182
Even so, the argument against the concept of compelled constructive keeping
is a strong one. And since the intent and knowledge of the gun-opposing
homeowner both seem relevant (intent and knowledge being elements of constructive
possession, as noted above), it may be useful to consider them separately
and in turn. The role of intent is counterintuitive, but not particularly
complicated. If intent is relevant to compelled constructive possession, what
should matter is an intent not to keep.183 Although Jon has not demonstrated an
intent to exercise control over Brad’s gun specifically, he has demonstrated an
intent (and ability, assuming he knows of the gun and is not legally prohibited
from removing it) to exclude all guns from his home. Brad’s gun falls within
that class, and therefore Jon has essentially demonstrated his intent with regard
to it as well. And even if Jon has not directly manifested an intent not to have
Brad’s or any other gun in his home—for example, because he does not know
that a gun has been brought to his home—that does not mean that his possession,
constructive or not, is intentional. Intent, after all, generally requires some
element of knowledge and willfulness. At best, Jon’s possession is unintentional
and involuntary, just as it would be if someone slipped a pistol into his coat
pocket without his knowledge.
The issue of unknowing possession requires a bit more work. Of course, it
is worth noting many if not most incidents of compelled keeping are knowing.
trespass and compelled possession shade into one another, the argument here is obviously
stronger.

whether the desired safety benefits outweigh the risks of deliberate or accidental misuse
that may result in death or serious injury, not only to residents of the home but to others
as well.”).
183. Otherwise, a person could only prove that he was being compelled to possess
something by demonstrating an intent to possess that thing.

The mandatory possession laws described in Subpart A.1 are known, or at least
easily knowable (constructively known, that is), to homeowners. And the
“forced entry” parking lot laws described in Subpart A.2 are no secret; businesses
know they are being forced to accept guns on their premises, even if
they do not know which guns and when.
It is also easy to imagine laws or even particular cases involving parties
who have been forced to keep a gun without their knowledge. But even in those
cases, it seems that the constitutional interests at stake—self-defense in the
home, primarily—are just as relevant, if not more so, than when the compelled
possession is knowing. Consider one final variation of the scenario: Jon does
not know that Brad has brought the gun into his home, perhaps because it was
concealed in Brad’s coat until he placed it on the end table out of Jon’s sight.
Are Jon’s self-defense interests any less implicated if he does not know about
the presence of the gun? It is hard to see how. A person who believes that his
home is less safe with a gun in it is not likely to be reassured if he is told that
people are bringing guns into his house without his knowledge. Indeed, inasmuch
as the right not to keep or bear is premised on self-defense interests, involuntary
and unknowing possession may be an even more serious infringement
of those interests. At least if a person knows that a gun is in his house
against his wishes, he can take some precautions—sending his children outside,
for example, or simply confronting the person who brought in the gun and telling
him or her to remove it (assuming, of course, that laws do not forbid him
from doing the latter).
In sum, constitutional self-defense interests are implicated whether compelled
keeping is actual or constructive, and might actually be heightened when
the possession is unknowing and involuntary. The idea of compelled keeping
therefore may not be quite as counterintuitive as it seems. Stated simply: if denying
people the ability to bring guns into their homes violates the right to keep
them, then forcing them to permit guns into their homes violates the right not to
keep them. In either case, what counts as “keeping” is defined by whether the
action in question implicates self-protection. If a gun on an end table is accessible
enough to be a useful weapon for self-defense, then it is also accessible
enough to be used in other ways as well—accidentally, impulsively, unsafely,
or for any of the other reasons that may have inspired Jon not to voluntarily
“keep” his own gun. The same conclusion follows for guns stored in basements,
attics, outdoor sheds, and the like. The symmetry seems inevitable.184
184. For the sake of that symmetry, I should note that I also believe that knowledge
should not necessarily be a required element of “affirmative” Second Amendment claims.
The issue would almost never arise, for the simple reason that—as explained above—
constructive possession convictions typically require knowledge as an essential element. But
if there were such a thing as a strict liability constructive possession statute, then a person
prosecuted for possessing a gun she did not know was in her home should be able to challenge
the law on Second Amendment grounds.

36 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 64:1
There is at least one more potential qualification to the idea of compelled
keeping, one that draws on the difference between keeping and bearing. Put
simply, how can Jon be “keeping” a gun so long as Brad is actively “bearing”
it? So long as it remains in Brad’s pocket, how can it ever enter Jon’s possession?
This is a strong argument, but it goes to the reach of the right not to keep
arms, not its existence. That is, one can recognize Jon’s right not to keep a gun
and still say that the right is not violated where Brad maintains immediate control
of the gun. Such qualifications would undoubtedly need to be worked out
in the context of particular cases—does the scenario change when Brad puts
down the gun? when he leaves it at Jon’s house?—and their resolution will depend
largely on how courts define the terms “keep” and “bear.” As noted in
Part I, that is a task courts and scholars have yet to undertake.
Undoubtedly, the simplest and most appealing answer to the string of hypotheticals
above is simply to say that even if Jon has been forced to keep
Brad’s gun, his constitutional rights have not been violated because there has
been no state action.185 For precisely the same reason, Jon can tell Brad to keep
the gun out of his house, and Brad will be without constitutional recourse. This
is worth emphasizing. Even if one accepts the existence of a right not to keep or
bear arms, it does not follow that one private party can use that right to force
another person not to bear arms in her presence, at least not without some
background right of exclusion. The question in all cases is whether the government
has infringed the right to avoid having or carrying guns.
 But as it turns out, a growing number of laws limit and in some cases
simply forbid private parties from exercising the right to exclude, and thereby
impair the right not to keep arms. In communities where these laws exist, the
pendulum of gun control has effectively swung away from where one might
expect to find it. Rather than limiting people’s ability to have guns, these laws
limit their ability not to. The government is thus not neutral with regard to gun
control, allowing individuals to decide for themselves whether to have guns.
Instead, it has intervened against people who seek to avoid them.
The following Subparts consider how Second Amendment doctrine might
evaluate the constitutionality of those burdens in three specific circumstances:
mandatory possession requirements, “take your gun to work” laws, and concealed
carry rights. Together, these laws show a useful spectrum of potential
infringements on the right not to keep or bear arms. Mandatory possession laws
infringe the right directly. Laws requiring businesses to allow guns on their
185. I am of course assuming that the Second Amendment, like most constitutional
guarantees, has a state action requirement. I am also assuming that if a property owner were
to call on the state’s authority to exclude a gun owner, doing so would not amount to state
action. But cf. Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1 (1948) (holding that federal court enforcement
of racially restrictive covenants constituted state action in violation of the Equal Protection
Clause). To the extent that the Second Amendment has no state action requirement, the argument
of this Article would be that much more relevant, for it would raise the constitutional
stakes of private parties’ efforts to keep guns out of their possession.

premises do so indirectly, by stripping private businesses and their owners of
the right to exclude guns and thereby forcing them to constructively “keep” or
“have” weapons on their property. And concealed carry laws potentially burden
(though do not directly infringe) people’s ability to avoid having arms by making
it harder to know when arms are being brought onto their property in the
first place.
Of course, even if these laws or others burden the Second Amendment
right not to keep or bear arms, it does not necessarily follow that they are unconstitutional.
After all, like the right to speak, the right not to speak has limits;186
it does not give people a First Amendment right not to testify in court,
for example.187 And just as the affirmative right recognized in Heller and
McDonald has limits,188 the right not to keep and bear arms would be subject to
regulations, limitations, and exceptions as well. The argument here is that laws
burdening the ability to avoid gun possession could give rise to Second
Amendment claims, not that those claims should necessarily succeed.
1. Mandatory possession laws
It may be useful to begin with a set of laws that directly implicate the right
not to bear arms: those requiring citizens to keep arms. Such mandatory possession
laws are rare, but because they create a straightforward burden on the
ability not to keep arms, they present a particularly useful illustrative example.
If the right not to keep arms means anything, surely it must be implicated in
cases where the government directly requires citizens to keep guns and ammunition
in their homes.
Mandatory gun possession is not widespread, but some communities have
either proposed or passed laws embracing it. Kennesaw, Georgia, is the most
famous example—it requires all citizens to keep guns and ammunition in their
homes.189 Similar laws have been passed in towns in Idaho, Kansas, Pennsyl-

vania, and Utah.190 Supporters of these laws sometimes say that they are “designed
to prevent gun control.”191 Recently, mandatory possession laws have
played a different political purpose, such as a South Dakota law that would
force every household in South Dakota to arm itself—an unsubtle jab at the recent
health insurance mandate.192
A supporter of mandatory possession laws might respond that such laws do
not threaten self-defense or personal safety—in fact, they promote it, since
widespread gun possession arguably deters crime.193 On this theory, gun ownership
creates positive externalities for the community. If criminals know that
many people in an area are armed, they will avoid it altogether, since their
chances of encountering armed self-defense are that much higher.194 Holding
aside the accuracy and relevance of the assumptions underlying this argument,
mandatory possession laws raise constitutional difficulties for precisely the
same reason as compelled subsidization in First Amendment doctrine. “The basic
idea of the compelled subsidization doctrine,” after all, “is that the First
Amendment prohibits the government from requiring some individuals to subsidize
the First Amendment activities of others.”195 If I have a right not to bear
arms, why should I be forced to subsidize others’ self-defense interests at the
expense of my own? If the government can infringe the right not to bear arms
by deciding that the community is safer with universal gun ownership, then
why can’t it infringe the right to bear arms by deciding the opposite and abAnna

olishing guns altogether? Either decision implicates Second Amendment
rights—in the latter case, those of individuals who wish to own guns for selfdefense;
in the former, those of individuals who want to keep their homes safe
by excluding guns.
Of course, none of this means that compelled keeping laws are per se unconstitutional,
only that they raise Second Amendment problems. One might
defend the laws on the ground that they are unlikely ever to be enforced. No
one has ever been prosecuted for violating the Kennesaw law, for example.196
So long as the laws are strictly symbolic and people are not actually threatened
with punishment for failing to keep guns in their homes, one could argue that
the right to defend oneself by not possessing weapons has not been infringed.
The District of Columbia unsuccessfully made a similar argument in Heller,
defending its safe storage requirement in part by arguing that it had never been
enforced against a person unlocking his or her weapon for use in selfdefense.197
The District, joined by the U.S. Solicitor General, suggested that
the law should be read—like other laws of general applicability—as having an
implicit self-defense exception.198 The Supreme Court, however, rejected this
argument, striking down the law because it did not contain an explicit selfdefense
exception.199 The same reasoning would seem to apply to compelled
keeping laws. Following the Heller approach, such laws should be unconstitutional
to the extent that they require people to “keep” arms against their own
self-defense interests, even if the laws themselves are not enforced.
This leads to a second possible defense of the gun-keeping laws, which is
that some of them—the Kennesaw law included200—contain a “conscientious
objector” exception. If this exception is broad enough to exempt those who object
to the law on self-defense grounds, then it may indeed head off Second
Amendment objections. Of course, if the exception is read that broadly, then
the law itself may be without much practical effect, since a large majority of
Americans—though perhaps not a majority within the communities that pass
compelled keeping laws—choose not to possess guns for self-defense. On the
other hand, if the law exempts only those conscientious objectors who oppose
gun ownership for religious or ethical reasons, then it is probably not broad

enough to protect the constitutional self-defense rights of those whose opposition
to gun ownership is grounded in safety concerns.
Finally, one might defend compelled keeping laws by appealing to historical
precedent, especially the Militia Acts of 1792, which provided that “every
citizen so enrolled [in the militia] and notified, shall, within six months thereafter,
provide himself with a good musket or firelock, a sufficient bayonet and
belt,” various other accoutrements, “or with a good rifle, knapsack,” and ammunition,
“and shall appear, so armed, accoutred and provided, when called out
to exercise, or into service, except, that when called out on company days to
exercise only, he may appear without a knapsack.”201 If the Framers countenanced
such a law, which effectively required people to keep arms, why should
mandatory possession laws be unconstitutional today?
This is a strong argument, but there are a few ways to answer it. First, the
Militia Acts only applied to people who were enrolled in the militia. It was
more akin to a draft than to a general law requiring keeping of arms. As such, it
arguably constituted a permissible regulation of the right not to keep or bear
arms, rather than a refutation of its existence. As explained in more detail below,
even a robust right not to keep or bear arms would not prevent compulsory
military service any more than the right not to speak prohibits compelled
speech in military contexts. Second, many constitutional rights are interpreted
in ways that would be hard to square with the content of Founding-era legislative
enactments. Modern First Amendment doctrine, for example, would of
course not countenance a law banning criticism of the government, despite the
fact that the Alien and Sedition Acts did exactly that in 1798.202 Finally, the
Militia Acts are somewhat hard to square with the holding of Heller itself. Heller,
after all, concluded that the Second Amendment “elevates above all other
interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of
hearth and home.”203 As their names imply, the Militia Acts focused on a different
set of interests—the militias, rather than the self-defense interests that
Heller and McDonald identified as the core and central component of the
Second Amendment.204 It would be unsatisfying, to say the least, if the government
could infringe those self-defense rights in the name of an Act whose
201. Militia Act of May 8, 1792, ch. 33, § 1, 1 Stat. 271, 271, repealed by Dick Act of
1903, ch. 196, § 25, 32 Stat. 775, 780.
202. See Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 626 (1992) (Souter, J., concurring) (“Ten
years after proposing the First Amendment, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts,
measures patently unconstitutional by modern standards. If the early Congress’s political
actions were determinative, and not merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning, we
would have to gut our current First Amendment doctrine to make room for political censorship.”).

very name invokes the Second Amendment interpretation the Court rejected in
Heller.
2. Laws forbidding the exclusion of guns from private property
Not all infringements of the right not to keep arms are quite so direct as
mandatory possession laws. A growing number of states have passed what are
variously referred to as “take your gun to work,” “parking lot,” or “forced entry”
laws. These forbid businesses and occasionally other private entities from
banning guns on their premises, or at least require them to permit guns to be
stored in cars in their parking lots. Though this imposition may not be as direct
as the mandatory possession laws discussed above, it does burden the ability of
private parties not to keep arms, and thereby implicates the Second Amendment
rights described here.
At least eleven states have passed laws limiting businesses’ authority to
exclude guns from their premises.205 Most of these laws focus on parking
lots,206 but their language is not always so limited. As the Tenth Circuit noted
in a decision rejecting a constitutional challenge to Oklahoma’s law, such laws
“hold employers criminally liable for prohibiting employees from storing firearms
in locked vehicles on company property.”207 Oklahoma’s law, generally
recognized as a pioneer, makes it illegal for any “person, property owner, tenant,
employer, or business entity” to bar any person besides a convicted felon
from bringing a gun onto “property set aside for any motor vehicle.”208 Florida’s
law, later struck down in part on unrelated grounds, prohibited an employer
from “discriminat[ing]” against a worker or customer “for exercising his or
her constitutional right to keep and bear arms or for exercising the right of selfdefense
as long as a firearm is never exhibited on company property for any
reason other than lawful defensive purposes.”209
Since most of these laws apply to businesses, one important threshold
question is whether businesses have Second Amendment rights. Heller and
McDonald did not confront this question, but it is nonetheless possible to ex-

plore the preliminary contours of an answer.210 Sole proprietorships and the
like presumably do, since they are effectively indistinguishable from the individuals
who own them. For other business entities, the answer is less clear.
Nevertheless, if a law were to ban guns at businesses, those businesses would
likely have standing to raise a Second Amendment challenge based on the selfdefense
interests of their employees and customers. The reverse, then, should
be equally true—businesses should be able to challenge laws requiring them to
permit guns on their premises if they believe that guns imperil the safety of
workers and customers. As a businessman in Florida put it, “Our company has
the right to make the rules. Same as in your house. You may tell people that
come to visit you they are not allowed to bring a firearm in the house.”211 And
just like homeowners, businesses face difficult problems of gun violence on
their property. One recent study found that businesses that allow firearms on
their premises are about five times more likely to be the site of a homicide.212
Requiring guns to be stored in a parking lot may not be enough to prevent such
violence.213
But even if the right not to keep arms exists and businesses can invoke it,
that does not necessarily mean that laws requiring businesses to allow the possession
of arms on their property violate the right. Arguably, such laws are necessary
to protect the rights of individuals who wish to exercise a right to
armed self-defense, and are thus in some sense grounded in the Second
Amendment’s core value of self-defense. In order to keep themselves safe, perhaps
people need to carry guns to or from the offices and businesses where they
work and shop—to protect themselves in a dark parking lot, or from an abusive
coworker, or from having a major purchase stolen before it can be transported

home. Threats to personal safety do not end—in fact, may begin—outside the
home.
For this counterargument to succeed as a constitutional matter, however, it
must be the case that businesses (some of them, anyway) are bound by the
Second Amendment, just as the company town in Marsh v. Alabama was
bound by the First Amendment.214 In other words, perhaps the Second
Amendment, standing alone, abridges private property rights in the name of the
constitutional right to armed self-defense.215 Such an argument—that the
Second Amendment requires businesses to permit private possession—would
be based implicitly on the notion that some businesses are effectively “public
self-defense forums.”216 Whether or not the analogy holds up is a question for
another paper, though it is worth noting that the Court has progressively moved
away from Marsh in its First Amendment jurisprudence.217 And even assuming
that the analogy does hold, it would not necessarily demonstrate the constitutionality
of laws requiring businesses to permit guns on their premises. Such
laws would be both unnecessary (because the Second Amendment itself would
guarantee such rights) and overbroad (because they would sweep in many businesses
that do not meet the “public self-defense forum” standard).
The First Amendment analogy is nonetheless useful, because the Court has
often grappled with situations in which the free speech interests of individuals
come into conflict with those of business owners—the same kind of conflict
that arises with self-defense interests in the Second Amendment context. And
where the Court has found that the First Amendment interests of the business
(i.e., in avoiding misattributed speech) are not sufficiently implicated as a practical
matter, it has rejected compelled speech claims and upheld government

Ctr. v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74, 85-88 (1980) (holding that private property owner could
not bar individuals from his shopping center on the basis of their speech).

Plaintiffs have not suffered an unconstitutional infringement of their property rights,
but rather are required by the Amendments to recognize a state-protected right of their employees”).

actors of violating the Second Amendment by forbidding guns on their property. See, e.g.,

interventions. In PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, for example, the Court
distinguished Wooley and rejected a shopping mall owner’s claim that a California
law requiring him to permit protestors into the mall violated his own
First Amendment right to avoid compelled speech:
The views expressed by members of the public in passing out pamphlets or
seeking signatures for a petition thus will not likely be identified with those of
the owner. . . . [A]s far as appears here appellants can expressly disavow any
connection with the message by simply posting signs in the area where the
speakers or handbillers stand. Such signs, for example, could disclaim any
sponsorship of the message and could explain that the persons are communicating
their own messages by virtue of state law.218
The Court reached a similar conclusion in Turner Broadcasting System,
Inc. v. FCC, which upheld the FCC’s “must-carry” provisions because “there
appears little risk that cable viewers would assume that the broadcast stations
carried on a cable system convey ideas or messages endorsed by the cable operator.”219
In PruneYard and Turner, then, the Court rejected compelled speech
claims because it found that, as a practical matter, no speech had been compelled.

But although the compulsion claims failed in PruneYard and Turner, similar
claims should succeed in cases involving firearms for the simple reason that
the latter cases implicate a relevant constitutional interest, while the former do
not. In the free speech context, misattribution is the relevant harm, and thus
constitutional concerns dissipate when no misattribution exists. In the Second
Amendment context, however, involuntary possession of the weapon—not misattribution
of possession—is the harm, because it raises the risk of an accidental
or other unwanted shooting. Whether third parties would consider an employee’s
possession of a gun to be an exercise of his right to self-defense or that
of the company is simply not relevant to that self-defense interest. And given
that, in the First Amendment context, the Court has concluded that it must also
“give deference to an association’s view of what would impair its expression,”220
it seems plausible that, in the Second Amendment context, courts
should be deferential to businesses’ and other private entities’ conclusions
about whether guns on their property promote or detract from safety.
But of course right-not-to-associate claims do not always succeed, and it
might well be that by opening themselves up to the public, businesses lose their
right to exclude gun carriers. I do not hazard a guess as to whether courts will
find that forcing businesses to allow guns on their premises violates the businesses’
Second Amendment self-defense rights. The point is simply that if a
business or other private entity determines that its premises are safest when
guns are excluded, then that decision should be entitled to the same degree of

deference and Second Amendment protection as the decision to permit gun
possession.
3. Concealed carry laws
The final category of laws that arguably infringe the right not to keep arms
does so much less directly. This category consists of laws that permit the concealed
carrying of firearms. To precisely the same degree that these laws make
it possible for gun owners to hide their weapons, they also make it hard for other
individuals to monitor whether guns are being brought onto their property or
into their homes and thereby into their constructive possession. Accordingly,
concealed carry laws burden—although do not forbid—the exercise of the right
not to keep arms.221 This of course does not make them unconstitutional; it
simply shows that concealed carry laws affect the self-defense interests not only
of those who wish to carry guns, but also of those who wish to avoid keeping
them.
Whereas it was once considered “cowardly” to carry concealed weapons,222
today mandatory (i.e., “shall-issue”) concealed carry permits are defended
as being “based on a simple principle: the right of self-defense.”223 As
David Kopel notes, “In the nineteenth century, concealed carry was often considered
outside the scope of the right to bear arms. Today, it is the most common
way in which people exercise their right to bear arms.”224 It is perhaps unsurprising,
then, that legislatures have responded by passing concealed carry
laws. Today most states have some version of a “shall-issue” statute, which are
known as such because they require officials to issue a concealed carry permit
to anyone who meets basic requirements such as not having a criminal record
or mental illness.225
221. Of course, the absence of a law permitting concealed carry does not necessarily
mean that people will carry their arms openly. But the argument here is not that the government
must ensure that people are able keep guns out of their homes, only that laws which
make it even harder to do so may raise Second Amendment problems. Many thanks to Brannon
Denning for pointing this out.

Leader and the Cincinnati Daily Times from April 1859, which applauded the Ohio General

this State, a most cowardly as well as murderous practice”); see also State v. Chandler, 5 La.
Ann. 489, 490 (1850) (stating that the right to bear arms is “calculated to incite men to a

46 STANFORD LAW REVIEW [Vol. 64:1
Whether or not such laws are wise policy is far beyond the scope and irrelevant
to the thesis of this Article. For present purposes, what matters is that
concealed carry laws make it more difficult for private parties to keep guns out
of their homes and off their property. That this is so as a practical matter is not
hard to discern. If a person shows up at my door bearing arms openly, I can decide
whether to welcome him as he is, slam the door, offer him ammunition,
tell him that he must leave his gun in his own home, or explain that he must unload
and store it safely while he is in mine. All of these are perfectly constitutional
exercises of my property rights. If, however, that same person shows up
with a gun concealed inside his coat, I may never know that a gun has entered
my home, and thus will not be able to exercise my right to exclude it and him.
That does not make it impossible for me to keep guns out of my home—I can
simply ask my guests whether they are bearing guns, and either trust their answers
or pat them down—but it does make it more difficult. By practically limiting
people’s ability to keep guns out of their homes, concealed carry laws
thereby burden their right to do so.
Of course, this in and of itself is not enough to demonstrate that concealed
carry laws are unconstitutional. First, it could be argued that concealed carry
licenses are not even a true form of state action favoring gun owners. If such
laws did not exist, then concealed carry would presumably be permissible by
default. And yet this seems to go too far, since concealed carry licenses do have
the effect of immunizing concealed carrying individuals from criminal or civil
liability. In that sense, they constitute state action just like any other licensing
system.226 Moreover, the government’s explicit approval of concealed weapons
may change social norms about when and where it is proper to carry them.227
In that sense, the state action may have a direct impact on private ordering.
Second, concealed carry laws do not directly forbid homeowners from asking
visitors whether they are armed or even frisking them prior to entry. The
state’s allowance for concealed carry is therefore at most an incidental burden
on the right not to keep or bear arms. As noted above, constitutional rights are
226. This draws some indirect support from the fact that the Supreme Court has routinely
held that licensing systems can be invalidated for impinging on constitutional rights. See,
e.g., Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558, 560-61 (1948) (finding permit requirement unconstitutional
because it imposed an “effective previous restraint” on liberty); Largent v. Texas, 318
U.S. 418, 422 (1943) (finding license requirement amounted to censorship); Cantwell v.
Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 305-06 (1940) (suggesting that license requirements place restraints
on behavior and such restraints constitute state action).

Norms, 96 MICH. L. REV. 338, 397-98 (1997) (“[T]he law can strengthen a norm merely by

subject to regulations,228 particularly incidental ones,229 and it may well be that
concealed carry laws are just such a constitutionally permissible burden.
Whether such laws should be upheld depends on what standard of review is applicable
to the right not to bear arms. And that, in turn, will depend on what
standard of review emerges for evaluating more traditional Second Amendment
claims, a question left open by Heller and McDonald.
230 So, too, does it remain
to be shown whether incidental burdens on Second Amendment rights, whether
of the affirmative or negative variety, should be treated the same as direct regulations.

Perhaps the right not to keep arms is not infringed even when a gun is
brought onto a person’s property, so long as that gun remains in the immediate
possession of (i.e., is borne by) another person. So long as an armed visitor
does not put her gun down or leave it lying around the house where someone
could put it to bad use, the argument would go, the danger of an accidental or
unwanted shooting is low and the homeowner’s safety is not at risk. But this
line of reasoning is unlikely to satisfy a homeowner who is wary of gun violence.
After all, accidental shootings by or of children and other family members
are not the only dangers a person may be seeking to prevent by keeping
guns out of his home. Maybe even more dangerous—because less controllable—are
the risks presented by armed visitors, even well-intentioned ones. If
the visitor has brought a loaded gun, secured only by a holster or in a coat
pocket, it may create an even more imminent danger than a gun kept unloaded,
locked, or stored in a safe. If a person believes that a gun is too dangerous to
have in the house even when he has control over its storage, he will almost certainly
be just as strongly opposed to having others bear their weapons in his
home.
Perhaps instead we must take into account the constitutional interests of the
person doing the concealed carrying. It might be argued that concealed carry
laws are simply a necessary part of protecting individuals’ right to “bear.” But
it would be somewhat odd if the Second Amendment were to impose such affirmative
burdens on the state. The heart of our constitutional rights tradition,

after all, is the notion that the government must refrain from involvement in
certain rights-related areas, not that it must involve itself. This is particularly
salient in the context of concealed carry rules, since there is a long American
tradition of regulating concealed weapons.231 That does not mean that government
must continue to do so, only that self-defense interests are implicated
whether or not it does.
Concealed carry laws illustrate how a person’s ability to exclude guns from
his or her home can be burdened by state actions favoring gun owners. But as
this discussion has attempted to demonstrate, that does not make them unconstitutional.

B. The Right Not to “Bear” Arms
If the right to bear arms means, as Heller found, the right to “carry” them,
then the right not to bear arms means the right not to carry them. That right is
more intuitively robust than the right not to keep—compelled carry rules surely
strike most people as unconstitutional, at least outside of military contexts—but
would have fewer, if any, practical implications.
The right not to bear arms has something of a historical lineage: the “conscientious
objector” exceptions to the Second Amendment proposed during the
Founding era. The Virginia and North Carolina proposals, which are representative,
provided that “any person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms ought to
be exempted upon payment of an equivalent to employ another to bear arms in
his stead.”232 States frequently wrote such protections into their own constitutions.
In 1868, seventeen states “had clauses that expressly prohibited compelling
people who are conscientiously (or otherwise) opposed to bearing arms
from being . . . drafted into militia duty.”233
These conscientious objector exceptions have typically been presented as
evidence that the Second Amendment is concerned with militias, since it would
have made little sense to contemplate a constitutional exemption for people
who did not wish to use arms for self-defense.234 Of course, Heller rejected that
argument and concluded instead that to “bear” a gun meant to carry it for pur-

‘confrontation’ or for self-defense.” (citation omitted)).

poses of “confrontation.”235 And in finding that the core of the Second
Amendment was the right to self-defense, the majority pointed to evidence arguably
showing that the conscientious objector exemptions were in fact focused
on self-defense, since “Quakers opposed the use of arms not just for militia service,
but for any violent purpose whatsoever.”236 This might be read to suggest
that the rejection of the conscientious objector exemptions indicates that people
can be forced to carry guns for self-defense purposes. That is, if the Framers
understood that Quakers were “religiously scrupulous of bearing arms” even in
their own self-defense, and yet rejected a provision that would have exempted
them from doing so, then perhaps the people can be compelled to bear arms for
self-defense purposes.
But emphasizing the self-defense purposes of the Second Amendment
gives “conscientious objectors”—those who refuse to carry guns, whether in a
militia or, as Heller suggests, in self-defense—a stronger constitutional claim
when it comes to not bearing arms. At the time of the Founding, exemptions
were opposed most strenuously by those who claimed that people who refused
to bear arms (in the militia context, of course) were falling short in their obligations
to society. Representative William Giles of Virginia, for example, opposed
the exemption for Quakers on the grounds that “[p]ersonal service . . .
was a debt every member owed to the protection of government, a debt which it
was immoral not to pay.”237 Reviewing Founding-era materials, Nathan Kozuskanich
concludes that “[b]earing arms for the state was an obligation for
every man who enjoyed the protections of the state.”238 Refusing to bear arms
in service of the state, then, meant abdicating a duty and imposing costs on others.

Those who object to the use of arms in self-defense, by contrast, do not
impose the same costs on the rest of society. Of course, one could argue that by
bearing arms against criminals, each gun-bearing citizen helps to deter crime by
raising the expected cost of crime for would-be criminals.239 But whatever the
policy considerations involved, surely the positive externalities of gun ownership
are not sufficiently high to justify abrogation of the right not to bear, at
least not any more so than negative externalities can justify prohibitions on
bearing.
235. Id. at 584 (majority opinion). It is slightly unclear what purposes are excluded by
this definition, though it would seem that possession of guns for hunting and target shooting
have no constitutional protection, since they do not involve “confrontation.” Cf. COOK &

In any event, even if the right not to bear arms exists and extends beyond
conscientious objection to military service, it has little practical importance, for
the government rarely forces citizens to carry arms.240 Today, the most likely
incident of forced arms-bearing is the military draft. Citizens who are conscripted
into military service are obligated by state action to “bear arms” at
immense cost to their own safety. If the Second Amendment protects a constitutional
right to defend one’s safety by not bearing arms, can these soldiers
raise constitutional arguments and thereby avoid compulsory military service?
Yes, and no. The draft undoubtedly impinges on the right to defend one’s
self by avoiding arms-bearing. But it does not follow that service members can
refuse to carry guns by invoking the Second Amendment, any more than they
can invoke their “affirmative” Second Amendment rights by bringing their own
guns to war, or refuse to salute their commanders because doing so would
amount to compelled speech. The draft implicates a wide array of constitutional
rights, including free speech,241 involuntary servitude,242 and equal protection,243
but the Supreme Court has rejected constitutional challenges on these
and other grounds. The same result would—and should—obtain if someone
were to assert his right not to bear arms.
C. Mediating Conflicting Rights
Recognizing a Second Amendment right not to keep or bear arms would
not create a constitutional trump card—it would not automatically invalidate all
state actions that burden one’s ability to avoid guns. It would, however, mean
recognizing that laws facilitating some people’s ability to bear arms may at
times conflict with the right of others not to.
This might seem more troubling than illuminating. If I have a right not to
keep arms, and that right can be violated when other people carry guns in my
proximity (or at least on my property), what is to prevent the Second Amendment
from being paralyzed by constant self-contradiction? Will the right not to
keep be in continual conflict with the right to bear? But in fact there is no reason
why this would be true, at least not any more so than the First Amendment’s
rights to speak and not speak have cancelled each other out. The reason,

January 2012] RIGHT NOT TO KEEP OR BEAR ARMS 51
simply stated, is that constitutional rights generally run only against the government.
As a result, no one could invoke the right not to keep or bear arms
against a neighbor any more than he could claim First Amendment rights
against him. For the same reason, no one could assert a Second Amendment
right to bear arms on other people’s private property.
It could nevertheless be argued that using one person’s desire to avoid
keeping arms as a justification for limiting another person’s ability to bear them
amounts to nothing more than the Second Amendment equivalent of a “heckler’s
veto.” In First Amendment doctrine, after all, the government is not permitted
to regulate speech based simply on the fact that the speech offends others.244
If the right not to keep or bear arms prevents the government from
passing concealed carry laws or requiring businesses to permit carrying arms
on their premises, wouldn’t that mean allowing some citizens’ objections to
trump others’ rights? Not quite. The heckler’s veto cases involve government
action—the state-imposed limitation of one person’s right to speak simply because
others object. The argument here, by contrast, is that the government may
not force objectors to engage in the constitutionally protected conduct they oppose,
not that the government can use their opposition to prevent others from
doing so. There is a difference between saying that the government has no constitutional
authority to force people to “keep” guns in their home and saying
that the government has authority to limit others’ right to bear them as they
please.
A third version of the argument would be that recognizing a right not to
keep and bear arms would effectively nullify the right to keep and bear them,
because the right to armed self-defense will be rendered ineffectual if people
cannot bear their guns in public and even occasionally on private property.
Without laws supporting concealed carry and requiring businesses or other establishments
to permit guns on their premises, gun-rights supporters might argue,
the right itself is worthless. The most obvious answer to this objection is
“So what?” It would be a strange constitutional right that required the government
to pass laws encouraging its effectuation, particularly at the expense of
other private parties invoking the same right. The First Amendment, for example,
places no obligations on the government to require one private party to
help another speak. Indeed, it generally forbids as much.245
If private ordering makes it hard for individuals to do things protected from
government interference—speaking, associating, keeping arms, and so on—that
is generally no concern of the Constitution. And yet it does stand to reason that
some private parties who have opened their property to the public or otherwise
become entangled with the government might thereby lose, at least to some degree,
their right not to keep or bear arms. This is, of course, the inevitable im-

plication of those (few) cases that have extended equal protection and First
Amendment rights onto nominally private property.246
Holding aside the state action exception, however, one might argue that the
government has no affirmative duty to support arms-bearing or arms-keeping,
but that it can do so if it so chooses. That is, the discussion here has shown only
that the right to keep and bear arms may conflict with the right not to. It has not
demonstrated that the latter should always trump the former. The First
Amendment analogy is again relevant, since free speech doctrine must often
grapple with problems involving government efforts to mediate the conflicting
claims of private speakers. As the Supreme Court explained in Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, “When two people converse face to face, both
should not speak at once if either is to be clearly understood.”247 Similarly, the
Court has recognized that “two parades cannot march on the same street simultaneously,
and government may allow only one.”248
Extending the analogy to the Second Amendment context, it might be said
that self-defense interests often come into conflict, and that the government
must have the power to make one set of self-defense interests yield to another.
In some situations or contexts, perhaps, the right to bear arms must trump the
right not to keep them. If, for example, the right to armed self-defense can only
be effectuated if people are able to bear guns concealed on their person, or in
others’ private businesses, then courts will have to decide which invocation of
the right should prevail: those of gun-bearers, or those of homeowners wishing
to avoid them. The answer to this question is not obvious, but there is good reason
to think that in some contexts, one person’s right not to “keep” should
trump another’s right to “bear.” Heller itself provides strong support for this
conclusion, by focusing on the importance of self-defense in the home.249 If the
self-defense right has special scope and power within the home, then it follows
that the right to keep guns out of the home should be similarly privileged, even
if that means that other private parties’ ability to take guns where they please is
limited as a result.
It is also worth reemphasizing that the right not to keep or bear arms would
not be any more immune to regulation than its affirmative cousin, and as with
any constitutional right there are many scenarios in which it might be reasonably
and permissibly infringed. Not all infringements of the right not to keep or
bear are equally invasive, and not all are presumptively unconstitutional. But
determining which are and which are not almost inevitably requires balancing,
or otherwise measuring the degree to which the right not to keep or bear has
been infringed. In Wooley, for example, the Court concluded that “[c]ompelling

the affirmative act of a flag salute involved a more serious infringement upon
personal liberties than the passive act of carrying the state motto on a license
plate, but the difference is essentially one of degree.”250 And of course parties
can be compelled to give testimony in court, which is itself a form of compelled
speech.251 If courts develop a Second Amendment jurisprudence that relies
on interest balancing—an approach apparently rejected in Heller252—then
they may end up weighing the interests of gun owners against those of homeowners.

All of this leaves the state in something of a bind. If it passes a “take your
gun to work” law, it might infringe the Second Amendment rights of people
who want to protect themselves by not having guns on their property. If it does
not pass such a law, then it might limit the ability of those who do wish to bear
arms to carry those arms where they believe they need them. But unattractive as
the latter result may seem to some, it is not necessarily a constitutional problem.
If private parties wish to ban guns in their homes, on their property, or
otherwise in their “possession,” the Second Amendment provides no recourse
for those people who wish to carry guns there. Nor, as I have attempted to show
here, does it permit the government to intervene on their behalf. This Article, in
sum, is not an argument for the desirability or constitutionality of gun control.
Quite to the contrary, it is an argument against certain kinds of government intervention
with individuals’ freedom to make decisions about the keeping and
bearing of arms.
CONCLUSION
Prior to Heller, it would have been difficult to argue that the Second
Amendment included the right to keep guns out of one’s home. Such an argument
would have failed for the same reason as a claim that the amendment protected
a right to keep guns in one’s home: the amendment was understood to
protect state militias, not individual self-defense rights. But by recasting the
Second Amendment as a guarantee of self-defense, Heller suggests that the
right not to keep or bear arms does exist for those people—apparently a majority
of Americans—who believe their homes to be safer without guns than with
them. Of course, that does not mean that the right will be invoked very often,
because—even including the examples explored in Part III—the government
rarely forces people to keep or bear arms.
One other limitation of the Article is worth emphasizing. Though the argument
here builds on analogies to other constitutional provisions, the right not
to keep or bear arms is wholly internal to the Second Amendment. It draws
whatever strength it has from the purposes of that amendment alone, and there-

fore has nothing in particular to say about other arguments against coerced activity.253
Most prominent among these, of course, is the current challenge to the
Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,254 which has been described not
only as exceeding Congress’s Commerce Clause and taxation powers, but also
as an infringement of the individual right not to engage in economic activity.255
The Second Amendment—and therefore this Article—speaks only to the keeping
and bearing of arms.
The logic of Heller indicates that just as the Constitution limits the government’s
power to burden citizens’ ability to possess arms, so too should it
limit the government’s power to burden their ability not to. Laws that make it
difficult or impossible to keep guns out of one’s possession therefore raise
Second Amendment problems. This may seem counterintuitive, but analytically
it is a logical, doctrinal result of the newly constitutionalized right to choose
whether to defend oneself with arms.
