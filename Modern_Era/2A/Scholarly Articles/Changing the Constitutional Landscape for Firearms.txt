Changing the Constitutional Landscape for Firearms: The US Supreme
Court’s Recent Second Amendment Decisions
Jon S. Vernick, JD, MPH, Lainie Rutkow, JD, PhD, MPH, Daniel W. Webster, ScD, MPH, and Stephen P. Teret, JD, MPH
In 2 recent cases—with important
implications for public
health practitioners, courts,
and researchers—the US Supreme
Court changed the
landscape for judging the constitutionality
of firearm laws
under the Constitution’s Second
Amendment.
In District of Columbia v
Heller (2008), the court determined
for the first time that
the Second Amendment grants
individuals a personal right to
possess handguns in their
home. In McDonald v City of
Chicago (2010), the court concluded
that this right affects
the powers of state and local
governments.
The court identified broad
categories of gun laws—other
than handgun bans—that remain
presumptively valid but
did not provide a standard
to judge their constitutionality.
We discuss ways that researchers
can assist decision
makers. (Am J Public Health.

HAVING GONE ALMOST 70
years without deciding a case directly
addressing the US Constitution’s
Second Amendment ‘‘right
to keep and bear arms,’’ beginning
in 2008 the US Supreme Court
decided 2 such cases with important
implications for the public’s
health. In District of Columbia v
Heller1 (decided June 26, 2008),
the Supreme Court concluded
for the first time that the
Constitution grants individuals
a personal right to possess handguns
in their home for protection. In
its decision, the court struck down
a 1976 District of Columbia law
that outlawed most handgun
ownership.
But the Heller decision left several
important questions unanswered,
particularly whether the
Second Amendment affects state
or local firearm laws or only limits
the power of the federal government.
In McDonald v City of Chicago2
(decided June 28, 2010), the
Supreme Court determined that the
Second Amendment does indeed
apply to laws enacted by state and
local governments. Nevertheless,
the McDonald decision also leaves
critical issues undecided, issues that
lower courts must now address and
that may affect the risk of firearm
violence for millions of Americans.
Firearms were associated with
more than 240 000 deaths from
2000 to 2007, including homicides,
suicides, and unintentional
deaths. During that same period,

GOVERNMENT, POLITICS, AND LAW
more than 530000 additional
nonfatal firearm injuries were
treated in hospital emergency departments.3
Laws at the federal,
state, and local levels seek to address
this public health burden.4
Evaluations of a number of these
laws indicate public health and
safety benefits; for other laws, the
effects remain controversial.5---8
We briefly review the history of
how the Supreme Court and lower
federal courts initially interpreted
the Second Amendment and examine
how the Heller and McDonald
decisions have changed that interpretation.
We also discuss the
implications for researchers, policymakers,
and the courts.
SECOND AMENDMENT
DECISIONS BEFORE
HELLER
According to the Second
Amendment, ‘‘A well regulated Militia,
being necessary to the security
of a free State, the right of the people
to keep and bear Arms, shall not
be infringed.’’9 Prior to the Heller
decision, there was little disagreement
among the courts about this
language’s meaning. In fact, until
Heller no federal appellate court had
ever invalidated any law as a violation
of the Second Amendment.
Two primary legal reasons
explained this virtual unanimity.
The first involves something lawyers
call the ‘‘incorporation doctrine.’’
When the Constitution was
first ratified, most of its provisions
specified the extent and limits of
federal government authority.
Even the familiar protections
enumerated in the Bill of Rights––
such as the First Amendment’s
freedom of speech and religion
clauses––initially affected only the
powers of the federal government,
not the state governments.10 In
1868, however, the 14th Amendment
was ratified, explicitly forbidding
states to ‘‘deprive any person
of life, liberty, or property, without
due process of law.’’11 As a result,
the Supreme Court began to decide
that most of the Bill of Rights
guarantees were included in––or
‘‘incorporated’’ into––the more general
language of the 14th Amendment
as a limit on state (not just
federal) powers. But the court has
never accepted the argument that
the entire Bill of Rights was incorporated
en masse, preferring a caseby-case
(right-by-right) approach.12
Until the McDonald decision,
the Second Amendment remained
one of the very few parts of the Bill
of Rights not so ‘‘incorporated.’’
In fact, in a pair of 19th-century
cases––United States v Cruikshank
(1876)13 and Presser v Illinois
(1886)14––the court found that the
Second Amendment limited only
the federal government. Numerous
state laws affecting gun ownership
have been upheld on this basis.15,16
The second reason why most
courts, before Heller and McDonald,
had little trouble upholding gun
laws involves the language of the
Second Amendment itself, specifi-
cally the ‘‘militia’’ clause preceding
the ‘‘right to keep and bear arms.’’
In 1939, the Supreme Court decided
United States v Miller, a case in
which 2 individuals challenged
their criminal indictment under
a federal law restricting sawed-off
shotguns.17 Because Miller involved
a federal law, the earlier Cruikshank
and Presser decisions were not directly
applicable. In Miller, the court
upheld the indictments, ruling that
the Second Amendment did not
protect the right to keep and bear
a firearm that did not have ‘‘some
reasonable relationship to the preservation
or efficiency of a well regulated
militia’’18 (see also Lewis v
United States19). Miller was a relatively
brief opinion without substantial
discussion of the basis for
its ruling. Nevertheless, lower
courts routinely upheld federal
and state firearm laws citing
Miller.
20,21
The first crack in this unanimity
among the federal courts came in
1999 with United States v Emerson.
22 As part of a divorce proceeding,
Sacha Emerson received
a restraining order forbidding her
estranged husband from threatening
her or their child. Mr. Emerson
had previously purchased a handgun.
But under federal law, individuals
subject to certain restraining
orders relating to intimate partner
violence are not permitted to possess
firearms.23
Emerson challenged the constitutionality
of the law in federal
district court. District judge Samuel
Cummings agreed with Emerson,
concluding that, unlike prior
federal decisions, the Second
Amendment granted individuals
a ‘‘right to keep and bear arms’’
regardless of any relationship with
militia service. He also determined
that the federal law violated that
individual Second Amendment
right.24 On appeal, the Fifth Circuit
Court of Appeals largely agreed
with Judge Cummings’ interpretation
of the scope of the Second
Amendment. But the court nevertheless
upheld the federal law in
question, concluding that the Second
Amendment right could be
subject to ‘‘limited, narrowly
tailored specific exceptions that are
reasonable.’’25
DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA v
HELLER (2008)
Well before Emerson, a lively
debate had emerged among
scholars regarding the proper interpretation
of the Second
Amendment.26 Some generally favored
the traditional interpretation
endorsed by nearly all courts, arguing
that it was justifiable by the
Constitution’s language and history.27,28
Others argued that the
Second Amendment should be
seen as protecting a personal right
to own guns unrelated to militia
service, a right that might affect the
constitutionality of some gun laws.
These authors urged the courts––
particularly the Supreme Court––to
reinterpret the Second Amendment
on the basis of its history, analysis
of the words in the amendment
itself, and early views of its
meaning.29,30 In 2008, with District
of Columbia v Heller, the court
accepted that suggestion.
Since 1976, the District of Columbia
had banned the private
possession of handguns that were
not owned and registered prior to
September of that year.31 Long
guns (i.e., rifles and shotguns) could
still be possessed in the home. Dick
Anthony Heller sought a registration
certificate for a handgun he
wished to possess in his home, and
the District of Columbia refused.
Five other individuals, including the
original lead plaintiff, Shelly Parker,
joined Heller in challenging the
District’s law. None alleged that he
or she was a member of any official
militia. The federal district court
rejected their arguments, relying
2022 | Government, Politics, and Law | Peer Reviewed | Vernick et al. American Journal of Public Health | November 2011, Vol 101, No. 11
GOVERNMENT, POLITICS, AND LAW
heavily on the Supreme Court’s
Miller decision. The court also
noted that all other federal courts
had declined to follow the Fifth
Circuit Court of Appeals’ reasoning
in Emerson.
32 The plaintiffs appealed
and the US Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia reversed,
striking down the District’s
handgun ban.33 The District then
appealed the case to the US Supreme
Court.
When the Supreme Court
agreed to hear the Heller case, this
represented the first time since
Miller in 1939 that the Supreme
Court had even considered a case
directly addressing the Second
Amendment. As a result, stakeholders
on both sides of the issue
mobilized in an effort to influence
the court. More than 30 friendof-the-court
(amicus curiae)
briefs were filed with the Supreme
Court by groups as diverse as
the American Public Health
Association, the National Rifle
Association (NRA), and the
NAACP.34 These amicus briefs
offered legal arguments as well
as public health and criminological
research about the pros and
cons of gun ownership and
regulation.
Writing for a 5 to 4 majority of
the court, Justice Antonin Scalia
agreed with the Court of Appeals
that the District of Columbia’s
handgun ban was unconstitutional.
In a lengthy opinion, Scalia
reviewed the Second Amendment’s
text, the history of its rati-
fication, early commentary on its
scope, and past cases. He relied on
a bevy of historical material as
well as some of the recent scholarly
writings to affirm that the
Second Amendment protects an
individual right not limited by
service in a militia. To reach this
conclusion, Scalia interpreted the
Miller decision differently than
most other federal courts, determining,
in part, that Miller means
only that the Second Amendment
does not protect those weapons
not typically possessed by lawabiding
citizens for lawful purposes,
such as short-barreled
shotguns.35
Other weapons, notably handguns,
which Scalia described as ‘‘the most
popular weapon chosen by Americans
for self-defense in the home,’’ 36
clearly fall within the protection of
the Second Amendment.
However, critically for public
health and safety, Scalia also acknowledged
that ‘‘[l]ike most
rights, the right secured by the
Second Amendment is not unlimited.’’37
In an oft-quoted portion of
the opinion, Scalia expanded on
some of these limitations:
[N]othing in our opinion should
be taken to cast doubt on longstanding
prohibitions on the possession
of firearms by felons and
the mentally ill, or laws forbidding
the carrying of firearms in
sensitive places such as schools
and government buildings, or
laws imposing conditions and
qualifications on the commercial
sale of arms.38
Scalia further assured the
reader that the court identifies
‘‘these presumptively lawful regulatory
measures only as examples;
our list does not purport to be
exhaustive.’’39 In fact, elsewhere in
the opinion, the court also mentioned
prohibitions on the carrying
of ‘‘dangerous and unusual
weapons’’ and ‘‘laws regulating the
storage of firearms to prevent accidents.’’40
Despite its length, the Heller
decision left at least 3 important
questions unanswered. Although
Justice Scalia listed certain presumptively
valid gun laws, some of
them––such as ‘‘laws imposing
conditions and qualifications on
the commercial sale of arms’’––
were described in very general
terms. Does this mean that any
such conditions on gun purchases
are valid? If not, then a second
unanswered question is what
standard should be applied to
judge the constitutionality of gun
laws other than handgun bans?
As Scalia acknowledged, other
constitutional rights are also not
absolute. Perhaps the most famous
example: despite the First
Amendment’s freedom of speech
protections, the government may
still prohibit (falsely) shouting
‘‘fire’’ in public places.41 For those
other constitutional rights, there are
generally standards that the court
applies to determine whether a law
affecting those rights may nevertheless
be upheld. Scalia did not
supply a specific standard.
In his dissent, Justice Stephen
Breyer specifically criticized the
majority opinion for this omission.
Breyer suggested that the
court adopt an ‘‘interest-balancing’’
approach requiring judges
to weigh ‘‘the interests protected
by the Second Amendment on
one side and the governmental
public-safety concerns on the
other.’’42 Scalia rejected Breyer’s
suggestion, believing that standard
to be inappropriate, and
concluded that the standard
should be allowed to develop
over time in future cases.
The third major unanswered
question from Heller is whether
the Second Amendment protects
an individual ‘‘right to keep and
bear arms’’ that cannot be infringed
by state or local laws or
whether it applies only to federal
laws. Because Washington, DC, is
a federal enclave, the question
never specifically arose in Heller.
This is precisely the issue raised by
McDonald v City of Chicago.
SECOND AMENDMENT
CASES IMMEDIATELY
AFTER HELLER
Even before McDonald was decided,
lower courts were faced
with new challenges to gun laws.
Overwhelmingly, the courts upheld
the constitutionality of these
laws. In some cases, the courts
simply applied Scalia’s language in
Heller regarding presumptively
valid gun laws, as in the challenges
brought by criminal defendants
against the federal law barring gun
ownership by convicted felons.43
Some courts applied one of the
existing standards of review identi-
fied by the Supreme Court for other
constitutional protections, but there
was little consistency in these decisions.
In other cases involving state
or local laws, however, some
courts relied on the much older
Cruikshank and Presser cases,
concluding that the Second
Amendment––even after Heller––
did not limit state or local gun
laws. These courts often acknowledged
that the Supreme
Court, not the lower federal
courts, retained the prerogative
of overruling or limiting its own
prior decisions.44,45 In McDonald
v City of Chicago, the court did
just that.
November 2011, Vol 101, No. 11 | American Journal of Public Health Vernick et al. | Peer Reviewed | Government, Politics, and Law | 2023
GOVERNMENT, POLITICS, AND LAW
McDONALD v CITY OF
CHICAGO (2010)
Otis McDonald and several other
plaintiffs were Chicago, Illinois residents
who wished to keep handguns
in their homes for protection,
but a Chicago law had essentially
banned handguns since 1982. Oak
Park, Illinois, had a similar law on its
books, and the courts combined
challenges brought by Oak Park
residents, the NRA, and other
groups into one decision. Both the
district court and the Court of
Appeals upheld the laws in question
citing Cruikshank and Presser.
In a 5 to 4 decision––with the
same 5 justices in the majority as in
Heller––the Supreme Court reversed.
Writing for the majority, Justice
Samuel Alito began by noting that
Cruikshank and Presser were decided
prior to the Supreme Court’s
more modern ‘‘selective incorporation’’
approach. To determine
whether the Second Amendment
should be incorporated via the14th
Amendment’s due process clause
as a limit on state power, Alito
wrote that the relevant inquiry was
whether the right to keep and
bear arms is fundamental to our
scheme of ordered liberty, or...
whether this right is ‘deeply
rooted in this Nation’s history
and tradition.46
For Alito, the court’s decision in
Heller and its review of the history
of the Second Amendment made
it clear that a right to self-defense
in the home with a handgun is
indeed deeply rooted in history
and tradition and therefore must
be incorporated. Alito also concluded
that historical evidence
both before and ‘‘immediately
following the ratification of the
Fourteenth Amendment only
confirms that the right to keep and
bear arms was considered fundamental.’’47
Among the arguments
that Alito rejected was the assertion
by Chicago and Oak Park that the
Second Amendment should be
treated differently, in that it ‘‘differs
from all of the other provisions of
the Bill of Rights because it concerns
the right to possess a deadly
implement and thus has implications
for public safety.’’48
Alito responded that ‘‘the right
to keep and bear arms, however, is
not the only constitutional right
that has controversial public safety
implications.’’48 The municipalities
also argued that incorporating the
Second Amendment would ‘‘stifle
experimentation’’ by states and
municipalities to address the specifics
of local levels of violence and
would simply lead to ‘‘extensive
and costly litigation.’’ Alito rejected
these claims as well.49
Importantly, Alito repeated Scalia’s
reassurance from Heller that
the Second Amendment right is not
absolute and that certain longstanding
types of gun laws are presumptively
valid. However, once
again the court declined to provide
a standard for lower courts to apply
in judging other gun laws. This
prompted a spirited portion of the
dissent by Justice Breyer, complaining
that ‘‘judges do not know
the answers to the kinds of empirically
based questions that will often
determine the need for particular
forms of gun regulation.’’50
IMPLICATIONS
The Heller and McDonald decisions
have important implications
for the courts, policymakers,
and researchers. Also, how these
groups respond to the decisions
will have important implications
for the public.
For the Courts
Immediately following both the
Heller and McDonald decisions,
individuals and pro-gun interest
groups challenged a host of federal,
state, and local gun laws. The
courts, therefore, have been
forced to apply the general principles
of the 2 cases but without
guidance from the Supreme Court
about a specific standard to govern
the constitutionality of a given
gun law. At one end of the spectrum,
broad handgun bans are
clearly impermissible. At the
other, certain laws, such as barring
felons from having guns, are presumptively
valid. But what will be
the status of the plethora of laws
falling somewhere in between?
What about laws banning only
specific types of handguns, such
as so-called ‘‘junk guns’’? What
about limits on the number of
handguns that can be purchased at
any given time (known as onehandgun-per-month
laws)? Or
prohibitions on those convicted of
misdemeanor (rather than felony)
crimes from owning firearms?
One of the first post-McDonald
cases involved precisely this type
of misdemeanor restriction. In
United States v Skoien, the federal
law barring gun ownership by
people convicted of certain domestic
violence misdemeanors
was at issue. A 3-judge panel of the
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals
initially concluded that the law
violated the Second Amendment.51
However, the full Seventh
Circuit Court of Appeals then
agreed to review the decision and
upheld the law.
The full Court of Appeals applied,
in part, a standard often
called ‘‘intermediate scrutiny’’
(because the burden on the government
in defending its law resides
somewhere between the
other 2 commonly used constitutional
standards, the ‘‘rational
basis’’ test and ‘‘strict scrutiny’’
standards). Under intermediate
scrutiny, the court concluded that
the federal law would be valid
if the government could show
that the law in question was ‘‘substantially
related to an important
government objective.’’52 To
apply this standard, the court
relied heavily on research regarding
the relationship between
domestic violence and firearms,
recidivism among domestic
abusers, and the risk of guns in
the home generally.
Under almost any standard of
review, the courts are likely to
consider, among other factors,
whether the law in question promotes
public health and safety
goals. This will necessarily involve
examining public health, criminology,
or other social science research.
Courts must therefore
have access to the relevant research
and be able to comprehend
its meaning, including balancing
conflicting claims in the contentious
area of guns and violence.
The need for judges to have
greater facility with scientific evidence
has long been recognized.53,54
For Policymakers
Probably the safest form of immediate
post-Heller and postMcDonald
prediction is for some
2024 | Government, Politics, and Law | Peer Reviewed | Vernick et al. American Journal of Public Health | November 2011, Vol 101, No. 11
GOVERNMENT, POLITICS, AND LAW
uncertainty about which gun laws
(other than handgun bans) will be
upheld and which judged unconstitutional.
In such a climate, there
may be a chilling effect for policymakers
contemplating new laws
intended to reduce firearm violence.
Legislators may remember
Heller’s assertion that many different
types of gun laws remain
presumptively valid.
In addition, laws that focus upstream
(as public health professionals
often advocate) on gun
makers and sellers, rather than
gun buyers and owners, may be
less likely to present Second
Amendment problems. Laws requiring
safer firearm design––
for example, devices to prevent
accidental discharge or use by
a child––can promote public
health without interfering with an
individual’s right to own a gun.55
Similarly, laws improving oversight
of gun dealers and targeting illegal
traffickers may not implicate the
core Second Amendment right of
gun ownership in the home identi-
fied by the Supreme Court.56
For policymakers proposing
new gun laws, establishing an evidence-based
legislative record
may be especially important. This
may mean holding hearings at
which researchers and other experts
can testify about the scientific
basis for new laws and including
language in the preamble
of the bill itself justifying the law.
Courts often rely on such information.
The city councils of the
District of Columbia and Chicago
followed this approach when rewriting
their gun laws after the
applicable court decisions. Each
city enacted new laws––short of
a handgun ban––intended to make
it difficult for high-risk people to
obtain firearms.57,58 Aspects of the
District of Columbia and Chicago
laws were immediately challenged.
These cases are pending.
Governments defending existing
laws may find it helpful to partner
with a variety of groups. Some
interest groups and law firms offer
pro bono legal representation or
other assistance. As in both Heller
and McDonald, public health organizations,
biomedical groups, and
researchers (as warranted by the
evidence) can provide friend-ofthe-court
briefs to aid courts.
For Researchers
Researchers must be prepared
to help judges and policymakers.
Researchers can work with policymakers
to translate scientific findings
into sound public policy.
They can assist courts directly
by serving as expert witnesses
at trials helping judges navigate
complex (and sometimes conflicting)
research.
Researchers can also anticipate
the kinds of gun laws most likely to
face constitutional challenges and
conduct new research to inform
decision makers. Many gun laws
have never been carefully evaluated.
But relevant research need
not be limited to direct evaluations
of the public health impact of gun
laws. Unbiased studies that consider
possible risk and protective
factors for violence may also be
useful for courts and policymakers.
Most gun laws can be divided
into one of 3 categories: laws
addressing potentially high-risk
people, firearms, and uses or contexts.59
In each of these areas,
additional research can assist decision
makers. As in the Skoien
decision, developing a better understanding
of which aspects of individuals’
prior criminal, mental
health, substance abuse, or other
history increase their risk for violence
will allow courts to assess the
potential public safety benefits of
new or existing laws. Several states
ban or regulate categories of firearms
deemed high risk, including
assault weapons, poorly made
handguns, and handguns without
certain safety features.60 Some of
these laws have already been challenged.
In Heller, Justice Scalia
identified laws restricting the carrying
of ‘‘dangerous and unusual’’
weapons as presumptively valid.
Research can help courts determine
whether some guns are ‘‘dangerous
and unusual’’ enough to warrant
regulating them.
Finally, firearms in some contexts
or places may be riskier than
in others. Federal law, for example,
forbids guns in school zones,61
and 18 states require guns to be
stored safely when not in use.62
Heller emphasizes the right to have
a handgun in one’s home. Research
may assist courts in determining
whether or how to extend the right
to other, potentially high-risk places.
New research and analysis
conducted by legal scholars and
historians can also assist courts
and policymakers. Research can
examine how the language of the
Second Amendment was developed,
interpreted, and applied to
specific types of laws throughout
the nation’s history. Scholars
can also consider and recommend
to courts appropriate ways to analyze
Second Amendment cases
on the basis of existing principles
of jurisprudence, including standards
of review.
Once a study is completed, researchers
should consider publishing
findings in forums that are
easily accessible to judges and
policymakers. In addition to peerreviewed
biomedical or social science
journals, researchers might
also consider secondary publication
in law journals or reviews
available in legal databases such as
Westlaw or Lexis/Nexis.
CONCLUSIONS
In the pages of this journal in
1993, an article concluded:
At some time in the future, the
Supreme Court may, in fact,
overrule Presser and Miller and
grant to the NRA and others the
interpretation of the Second
Amendment they seek. Until that
time, however, public health advocates
should understand that
the Second Amendment poses no
real obstacle to the implementation
of even broad gun control
legislation.63(p1776)
That time has arrived. Public
health researchers and advocates
must now be prepared to assist
courts and policymakers as we
have described.
For now, however, the full impact
of these 2 cases remains unclear.
But if policymakers and
others fear acting to protect public
health and safety because of the
decisions that courts might make
in the future, this could have farreaching
implications for the millions
of Americans who wish to
live free from the threat of firearm
violence. j
